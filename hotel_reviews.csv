", 10 ,"After a disastrous travel day, I was desperately searching for a hotel with an available room.  I found the Newbury through Booking.com (after midnight)...upon arrival the staff was incredibly kind, the hotel was beautiful, the room and the shower were so lovely and so very welcome at that point in the day.  The Nespresso machine in the room and the real china cup to drink coffee from were above and beyond and such a needed balance to the rest of the day.  The hotel is pricey - or perhaps just my late notice room was - but to me it was worth every penny.  I'd love to see it in daylight :-)",not a thing,"

", 9.0 ,"We stayed at the Newbury for 4 nights. The location is absolutely perfect! The building is charming and the build out of this historic property is beautifully done.  The staff were wonderful… pleasant, helpful and professional.  Macie (sp?)- the Concierge- was incredibly helpful with everything we needed.  We loved the Street Bar- excellent drinks and atmosphere. Valet team was fantastic- had my husbands car ready for him at the time he requested every morning and he raved about the complimentary coffee and pastry in the Library.  Brunch at Contessa on Sunday was delicious and gorgeous.  The rooms were nicely appointed and beautifully done…. so quiet and incredibly clean and maintained… however…see below","We had a park view room on the 6th Floor.  There was a constant smell of kitchen exhaust in the hallways walking to and from our room every day. if the smell of cooking meat is an issue for you- do not stay on a lower floor. The cooking smell was not present in the room, but we did have another smell issue in the bathroom- there was a mildew smell in the shower- presumably from the drain.  It was bearable, but noticeable. The phone and iPad were not operational- the phone needed to be re-programmed and we were told they were having issues with the iPads not working- they only show the time and hotel information.  Not a deal breaker, but would have been a nice perk.  The only other issue - a suggestion really- for those of us who like a dark room to sleep in, it would be great to have a strip of something across the top of the curtains (which are lovely btw!) to block out the morning sun.","

The card did not work to one of our two rooms, so they had to be programmed twice. It took an hour each time, which can make a difference to tired travelers, but once it was resolved, everything else was more than great.

", 7.0 ,"I chose this hotel instead of the downtown location because of the lower price. The train station is a 5 min walk down the road, so it's convenient if you want to explore the city. The room suited our needs with some good amenities. The beds were very soft and comfortable.
The overall experience was not too bad.","The view is nothing to write home about. Industrial view of the Santander parking lot across the street.
This place could use some upkeep. The front doors are stiff and difficult to open unless you press the automatic door opener every time. Even the automatic door opener is a bit finicky.
Like other reviewers, I also had the experience of the tub draining very slowly. The water drained eventually, but it's not a pleasant experience to stand in dirty water when you're trying to shower.
We didn't bother to try the breakfast since it cost extra and the quality looked about the same as any continental breakfast.
I was excited to stay in a DoubleTree for the first time since I'd heard good things about the cookies. However, they were disappointing. They were warm, but dry. Also, I never knew they contained nuts. Seems unnecessary given the amount of people with nut allergies. Most people prefer a regular chocolate chip cookie, so adding nuts just seems like a waste.
For the price point, the standards should be higher. Next time, I'd choose a different hotel over DoubleTree..","

I tried a stale croissant, stale toast that was supposed to be french toast, no fruit, just a small selection of generic, basic, not fresh, hotel food. Most lower class hotels would have these type of items for free.  The parking is $20 a day and it's at a nearby college. The view is of a parking lot under construction, with a distant bay view.

Loved all the records. Our ac was cranking and the bathroom was comfy and cute. Great location for Fenway Park and for visiting our niece at college.,The pool was surprisingly chilly. We went for a dip before bed and it was freezing. Would’ve been more relaxing had it been warmer. Also our king bed wasn’t super comfy and my husband and I didn’t sleep great.,"

Although we recognize this is the""Standard American Diet"" (and the most cost effective for the hotel), for a $700/night stay it would have been nice to have more options for those of us who are keto/paleo, especially for health reasons.  Also, the shower stall in the room was very modern and unique,but the tile on the floor of the shower was pretty slippery, which could be a little risky.","

The room was really spacious and very clean.,"Walls are rather thin so you can hear your neighbors if you're unfortunate and they tend to be a little loud (which was true in my case). Location is an easy, fast Uber drive to most locations in Boston / Cambridge but you can't really walk to a lot of places. However, this also meant that the price for our rooms, though still high, was a lot cheaper compared to other hotels in more central locations.","

Also the location is 4 start worthy if you plan to get a Charlie card and take the public transit system.  If you rented a vehicle the free parking is also somewhat of a rare find.","Sadly the restaurant shut down during the pandemic so room service and staying in is not an option. 
While I did enjoy the modern art and all night coffee bar the rooms are small and the view, not spectacular. The carpet was lifting up on areas, bathrooms needed to be recaulked and the elevators were painfully slow.  There is no pool and outside of your room precious little space to relax if it’s been raining.","

", 8.0 ,"the hotel accommodated my wish for a good view of the harbor. The facilities were very neat and clean and the bathroom had HP adapted facilities, some of the best I have seen. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating.","as a person with a disability I use a power wheelchair and Hoyer lift to access the bed. It would be great if there were standard heights for a bed so that Hoyer lift can fit under it. Like  8 inches of clearance. As it was, this hotel like many hotels had a box type set up under the mattress. Other places I have been to remove the box portion and put the leg rests of the bed up on wooden supports to raise the height of the bed. At this hotel, they very quickly and courteously had 2 or 3 hotel staff come to the room and lift the end of the box bring up so we could fit the lift under the bed. Kinda bad for them and a little annoying for us, though they were very nice, I wish it were not such an issue every time I go someplace.","

", 8.0 ,"If you are going to Boston to tour the city and its monuments, this is not the place to stay. This hotel seems to have 1 purpose only: it is the port hotel for cruises that sail from Boston Harbor. Since I was on a cruise, this was just fine with me. Their pool is indoor, but it is very clean and well-maintained. I also appreciated the fact that they had A LOT of chairs in the lobby. With ""the cruise crowd"", seating could have been a real problem, but it was not. Kudos!","This hotel needs a real restaurant! I was not impressed by their AM breakfast bar. When I arrived there at 8 AM, there was very little left to eat. Seating is also a problem: too few tables. I realize that there are a few restaurants within walking distance, but these are mainly dinner restaurants that specialize in fish. It was raining the night that I stayed there. I stayed in the hotel, which meant that my dinner consisted of a selection of VENDING MACHINE foods. Not quite what I had in mind! For this reason, I could never recommend this hotel for more than a 1-night stay...","

", 8.0 ,"Wide room with a lot of space for baggage. Comfy beds and modern furniture.
Taking into account that breakfast is American style, it is really good with many different options to choose from.","It is far away from the city centre and this means walking 30 minutes in the morning and other 30 minutes at night, when you are already tired. This time it was tiresome for me to do so much walking.
In spite of the comfy room, there was a strong noise from an engine 24hs non-stop, which made it really hard for me to sleep. I had to use earplugs.
I don't like having to pay for a deposit of 300$ during my stay. I consider it excessive and unnecessary, especially when I have paid 325$ a day for the room.  This is a common practice in the country which I have never understood because, to be honest, they already have your card details so, if something happened, they don't really need to block a quantity. When you change like 6/7 hotels on vacation, this means a lot of money blocked which you can't use for days until unblocked.","

Rooms were perfect for what we used it for and the shower was one of the better I’ve seen in a hotel.,The mini fridge in the room hardly kept things even a little cool. Maybe it’s time for an update for some. The pillows weren’t the most comfortable things.,"

I arrived and the room I was supposed to go into wasn’t ready, so they moved me to a different room, but there were still feathers on all of the bedding. The front desk person had them send up one non-feather pillow when I checked in, which required me to call down and explain again that I couldn’t have feathers on the bed. It was all taken care of, ultimately, but was a lot of extra calling and effort on my part to get it taken care of.

Showering was not restful.  Also, we had an odd shaped room (it was not a typical four sided room - the closet stuck out into the room blocking the TV view a bit).  That made the energy a bit odd, but the bed was great and we crashed quickly, so it all worked out.   Just ask for a different type of room if these things bug you.","

My 2nd room with panoramic views, the hotel has a TV etc blocking the window views.
 Breakfast was quite a different experience than dinner. One meal had a piece of metal in the waffle which the server did bring a new one. Great customer service, it should have been removed from the bill. The other meal, the toast was not toasted, eggs not cooked properly, yet the breakfast was $54.00.  I understand it's a hotel, then it should be the caliber of that price not a meal of Denny's that would cost roughly $15.00.","

", 8.0 ,We enjoyed our June 2021 vacation in Boston. The hotel location was very convenient to public transportation and most tourist activities. Overall we were happy with this Hilton  property. We knew that due to Covid protocols there would be limited housekeeping and dining options. My husband and I are fine with reduced housekeeping services. We were staying for 5 nights and were not given sufficient towels and washcloths upon arrival.  It was ridiculous how difficult it was to get more delivered to our room.,N/A,"

Complimentary hot drinks in reception a nice treat",Rate for the thursday night was quiet expensive at over $500 even though still one of the cheapest for that night,"

When you choose ""pay at property"" and it says no prepayment needed that is exactly what I expected...;knowing we would be arriving late I had each main person in the other two rooms I booked call ahead and give there cards.
Ashley called the evening before trying to put all the rooms on mine.  When I tried to have a conversation with this person I was simply talked over and told she needed to hear from the others by morning or she was canceling our rooms.  So where is the no prepayment required?   Where is the pay at property?  And I'm sure my husband and I were given one of the smallest rooms in this hotel for my complaint against her.  Our room was just big enough for a bed.  In order to have room and move around we had to put our bags in the bathroom.","

This was my second stay. Both times the room was spotless clean. The beds are quite comfortable.  The room is very basic and on the small side, but very doable.  If you want luxury then you go to a very expensive hotel.  However,  if you want a clean hotel room to stay in while doing something I Boston, this is definitely it.
Plus the location is an excellent base to go about Boston.  Large parking garage across the street, morning coffee and doughnuts just up the street,  and a friendly staff is the ""icing on the cake""!","Taking in the fact that this hotel is for the budget minded,  I can't complain.  Just make sure to ask for a room with a window with something of a view and a small desk.","

", 9.0 ,I was happy that I was able to check in and then return my car to the airport rental car center and walk back to the hotel. The proximity to the airport was a definite plus. A staff member helped me take my luggage to my room. Breakfast was good. I also liked the fact that there was a place to buy some food and drink when I arrived later in the day. I liked being able to make my cups of tea in my room. I also liked the large sized televisions in both rooms of the suite. I also liked the shuttle service to the airport and the helpfulness of the driver.,Not much to report here.,"

The internet worked well the main TV was large and sharp.,"This hotel is a bit bla in terms of decorations, lighting, and artwork. Black and white photos, while trendy a few years back added to a boring design. The room was almost identical to what you would find at a Homewood Suites, BUT, no kitchen and at nearly $500 per night. twice the price!

Room cleaning had to be scheduled for a week's stay but extra supplies were available upon request and delivered in a very short time. A shuttle was available to and from the airport and the airport T station at no charge. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.,"The hotel was farther from the city center than we thought, but not as expensive as the downtown hotels. Nothing that we really disliked.

Two days in a row the men's restroom off the bar and dining room were without paper towels. It appeared this had not been attended and made me question cleanliness.

But since we were there strictly because an international flight hiding for NYC was diverted due to NYC thunderstorms, this was hardly a matter of choice.","The hotel took advantage of  our situation by charging $297 for a few hours sleep unit the next day's attempt to  fly  home. Swissair has promised to recompense all of the affected passengers but the air of ""rip-off"" hangs  heavy over the ""let's ick them when they are down philosophy. Also, all passengers had to wait on a long line of up to hours to just check in and get their keys.

", 7.0 ,The breakfast was good. The staff we encountered were all extremely polite and helpful. The staff was very attentive to our needs when we called for our room. The shuttle was very convenient and timely. We arrived early and we were able to check our bags until our room was ready. The staff even held some cold items in the refrigerator for us.,"The room was small, the beds were very uncomfortable. Happy hour was not well tended to at 5:30 with an hour left, the chips were out no plates were restocked. The Coca Cola tasted funny. The restroom in the lobby was out of paper towels , I know the staff was told by at least three different people, and they were not restocked, by the time we went back upstairs at least an 1/2 hour later. The prices in the bar and convenience store were a bit excessive. The total stay was qu Ute pricey!","

", 10 ,"This hotel was exactly what we needed after 10 days of travel, ahead of flying home. Very helpful staff, early check in when we turned up early to chance it, large and comfortable room with enough space for all our cases so we could sort ourselves out. Bed was great, bathroom had a huge walk in shower which was excellent. Everywhere was clean, and it was generally just chilled to be there. The pool was a nice amemity to be able to relax and unwind after a long day. Check out at 12 is really great, and they were so helpful with sorting two shuttle trips for us, storing luggage after check out, as well as printing boarding passes - they even took our postcards for us to post as we didn't have time. Just expert service for what you need before long haul travel. For the cost of the room, when you take into account saving on Ubers etc with the shuttle service, free WiFi, and flexibility around your check in and check out times, it's absolutely worth the money.","It's only a minor annoyance but the air con/heating fan in the room hums all the time, it was a little annoying when trying to sleep.","

We had to wait 45 minutes between shuttle buses. We just missed the first one (we saw it drive away when we exited the building). Called two times to ask about timing.

", 8.0 ,"shuttle was very convenient and pickup times were reasonable.
Breakfast was delicious.  However, there wasn't enough staff on our visit of 6/19.  Continental breakfast ran out of coffee and OJ.  I had to go find a waitress to take our order because we were in the corner and being missed...others were being served before us. 
The dinners were very reasonably priced and delicious. Was nicely surprised at this.
Someone said that the front desk would give you complementary bottles of water if you asked.  I bought one from the ""shop"".  You'd think a front desk person where I paid would have just given me one instead of me buying some.  I think some should be in the fridges in the room all ready for the guest.
Bathroom was beautiful and clean.",see items above,"

Cleaning team members were very pleasant and accommodating, hardworking.","Prior to our stay i asked about a special request for our long-awaited week away, yet never heard back after repeated email attempts. Upon arrival it was apparent the request was never attempted. There was a water outage one day and staff failed to inform us guests, we only found out after inquiring about it ourselves, it was never restored that day. They were nice enough to set us up with a room at a nearby hotel for the night to shower/refresh and sleep, yet it ruined one full day of our trip.","

We were lucky to have been upgraded and also we're given free chocolates for our stay. It was an incredibly comfortable room and the view was amazing. It is about a 20 minute walk from the middle of boston and Public transport isn't great, but I'd still stay here again",I would personally avoid the sportman club and the foyer bar as I found the service there quite slow and rude compared to previous experience.,"

", 10 ,"I usually don't do reviews, but I cannot rave enough about how amazing this stay was!! 
It was my husband's birthday, so I booked an overnight getaway to de-stress from daily life. The Omni texted me the night before our stay and asked if there was anything they could do for our stay. I told them it was his birthday, and requested a room with a tub. When we arrived, not only did we get a lovely corner room on the top floor with a tub, but we also got stunning views and privacy! And to top it off, the hotel sent us a lovely bottle of rose sparkling wine and a decadent dessert! It was unexpected and fabulous!! 
And the staff are so friendly, helpful, and warm! When my husband went to get a beer after taking a dip in the roof deck pool, the attendant recognized him and whispered to the bar staff that it was his birthday so he had free drinks!  It was so great at the Omni that we cancelled our evening plans and we ended up just enjoying the amazing hotel, room and the views! 
We're Bostonians born and raised, so it's not easy to please us! But the Omni Seaport definitely did!",Nothing! It was a perfect weekend away!,"

The rooms were really good too - spacious, spotlessly clean, great rain shower and the beds super comfy.","Only a coffee shop available - which was considerably more costly than surrounding options.  There was a small bar counter which also opened for evening drinks; however, it didn't have much atmosphere to it.  The hotel is a great base: to sleep, change and move on from there - so misses a few hospitality opportunities.  Would however recommend!","

", 8.0 ,Great hotel that was very central which made a lot walkable which is always good.  Staff were great and helpful.  Nice room.   Huge bed but pillows very soft.  One pair of slippers and one housecoat for a double room.  Huge shower with toiletries replenished every day which is always useful.,Not keen on the $35 a day charge for the wifi and water/coffee etc. We were there for week - quite chunky.  Read the small print.  I didnt notice until the final invoice.  I was a little concerned about room position (right at the elevator) and I would normally have asked for a change.  Only one night was noisy in the hall (Halloween weekend).  The hotel very kindly sent an apology in the form of wine and chocolate which was very unexpected but was greatly appreciated.,"

Today I’m back at home, and I saw that they charged me twice for a room. Everything has been really hard work. People at reception pretend to be helpful, they say that you will get a refund between three and five working days and that is simply not true. They also blame the system with regard to everything.

I can’t recall any query or request without a satisfactory feedback. The complementary bottle water (comparing 4$/bottle in other hotel) and snacks are good catch. Probably that represent the generic quality of Boston.","(1) The king studio Room size is just OK for family of 3, but it matches the price. Good value for money. (2) Stayed at highest floor to avoid noise from street, while bit annoyed by the centralised AC noise from the roof during the first night.

was spacious enough with 4 items of luggage.","The bathroom was pretty but lacked functionality: one towel rack in a room for 2 people? put some hooks on the wall behind the toilet niche! The shower was also very spacious, the pressure strong and water hot but there was one very small corner shelf for toiletries- I had to leave my items on the floor. Finally, there was a magnifying mirror, which I love in a hotel room but it was on the wrong side of the vanity- to use it you need to squeeze in front of the toilet!

We wanted somewhere close to get some rest so we could get up early and get our day started.  The room was much bigger than expected and the bed/bedding was very comfortable.  Being right at the airport we expected to hear the planes and such, but to our supersize, the room was completely quite!   We had dinner in one of the hotel restaurants, food and service were great.  Breakfast in the other restaurant was standard hotel breakfast with great service.",I know prices have gone up but thought breakfast could have been better for the price.  The food was standard but nothing to wright home about.  The staff were friendly and talkative which is always nice.,"

if you are flying in or out of terminal C, (and I think A &D) then you need to call for the Shuttle. when they say it is linked by an air ridge, it’s a bit of a long bow. it’s at least a 30 min walk. it’s not like Melbourne where you walk directly across from the baggage collection and it’s a 2-3 min walk. if you are an Australian & flying with qantas affiliates, you will fly into terminal C (American airlines) which is the furthest away, and I would consider a slightly longer shuttle ride and pay significantly less at one of the other nearby hotels","

Bed was very comfortable and bathroom modern. Staff were very nice and helpful.,I booked a business king and they put me in RM.443 which was a handicapped room. They changed me no problem. They might want to review their policies. 1. They should save those rooms for those that need them. 2. Tell the customer they intend to put them in a handicapped room. Also. Room price seems high.

Next time I'm in town we'll stay at another hotel and use uber to get to the airport.,"

Very clean, very modern appliances and facilities, nice amenities in room, nice breakfast room.","Parking situation is terrible.  They only valet park car now because there are too few spots, and the lot is less than 20 feet away from the front door so it's more of an inconvenience now than simply pulling into an open spot like any other Marriott hotel. Charge $40 a day for parking, although they never did before - and they don't make mention of the valet charge.  Valet does not always pick up phone when you call down to get car pulled up.  The better solution would be to extend parking lot, build a garage, figure out another solution. But given the cost involved, they've opted for the cheaper (more customer inconvenient) solution of valet parking, leaving keys at front door.  Remember to bring second set of keys!","

", 10 ,As most reviews stated the property was dry clean as well as the rooms. The $40 per day parking was a bit extra but it seems to be the in thing with these hotels and the valet personnel were very polite and precise. I appreciated that we were able to warm our food in the microwaves which were not in room but on each floor called the hydration station but the microwaves were very clean and well kept. I would stay again. Our room was on the back side of the hotel where there was metro train track but the noise was not very noticeable. I would say that the noice the air/heating system made when it got started was louder than the train but then the ac/heat noice subsided as well. I recommend this hotel and you wouldn’t be wasting your money. The front desk staff were overly friendly and made every attempt to make your stay comfortable.

", 8.0 ,"Location of the Hotel was great, on the water (but definitely NOT a 6-minute walk to any beach as noted in the description). 10-minute walk through a park and over the pedestrian bridge to North station/TD Center. Basically, located on the north portion of the Freedom Trail. On the harbor and Thursday-Sunday nights summer 2022 there is a beer garden atmosphere is provided out on the hotel dock area.
The included breakfast was wonderful (waffles and a choice of syrups, breads/muffins (+gluten free bagels), scrambled eggs, daily meat option (bacon, Canadian bacon, pork sausage, turkey sausage plus veggie sausage), apples/bananas, boiled eggs, yogurt/oatmeal and toppings, milk (whole, skim, oat), coffee, tea selection, sodas (Pepsi products), fountain juices. Sunday included biscuits and gravy. The two workers at breakfast kept everything well stocked and took care of any needs. Our daughter enjoyed getting her daily iced coffee and Nutella. Our boys were satisfied with fruit loops and the adults actually ate the real food.
Downstairs had a little market for frozen meals that could be heated. The kitchenette had a small coffee pot, toaster, 2-burner stove top, microwave, full sized fridge and small dishwasher (no oven).
Lisa at the front desk was wonderful, was able to check us in early. After a 5am flight and travel day, being able to check in and rest and get settled was crucial in starting our vacation with three kids well. We were able to quickly get items from housekeeping like extra towels, blankets, pillows, silverware, plate, cup and an additional chair for our dining table since we had five in our room.
Queen sized beds in the bedroom were comfortable. Dark out curtains and 4th floor room faced the bridge, but traffic noise was not a problem. USB charging ports/alarm clock in the bedroom, but it accidently got set for 6am one day. Plenty of outlets elsewhere to satisfy our teens charging needs. TV had Netflix, showtime (but not...","The pull-out sofa was incredibly uncomfortable. Our teen daughter only got three hours of sleep one night when she finally took the couch cushions and made a bed out of them on the floor. She said it felt like sleeping on springs. I wish we had asked the hotel to bring up a roll-away bed, but we were already paying $575 per night for the room and didn't want to add another $25 per night. So, we just took turns sleeping on the pullout couch.
One day there was a smelly hallway but when we came back someone had used air freshener. We are accustomed to 2.5 star rooms, so the cleanliness factor was sufficient for us. We are not the type that can't stand to see some peeling wallpaper. Boston hotels are expensive so expecting the pristine conditions and same quality from a same priced Marriott in another cheaper city is unreasonable.
We booked here after being suddenly cancelled on by Booking.com at another location. We had originally spent $1300 on two hotel rooms closer to Boston gardens only to find out the 'hotel' was actually a corporate housing rental organization called SoBeNY that didn't even have a real location. While Booking.com agreed to refund 2/3rds of the increased price if we rebooked with them, we are still working to see if they will credit the full amount ($950) we had to pay in order to find a place to fit our family of 5 last minute. All their representatives were in another country and couldn't get permission to refund us more than an increase of $25 per night. Which, of course when you get cancelled on last minute, is impossible to find. If you are interested in this hotel, use a different booking site if possible.","

It took a person from maintenance almost 30 minutes to get the couch opened and then it had to stay open the whole time we were staying in the hotel since it would have taken them another 30 minutes in the morning to close it. The hotel knows these couches are broken and always need major work and tools to open and close, so it is totally unprofessional that they don't put working pullout couches in the rooms, especially in a 1-bedroom suite in which the hotel is advertising that more than 2 people can sleep in.","

We had to call a plumber twice because the toilet kept backing up and spilling out onto the floor. The beds were really uncomfortable.

Our room had a good view of the waterfront, and the Provincetown ferry leaves from the pier across the street. The hotel’s Aura restaurant was very good for breakfast and the Tamo Bistro was good for dinner.  The T Station (Subway) is a convenient short walk away at the WTC building for travel throughout Boston.","There was a lot of construction underway in the Seaport area, making it very noisy and difficult to walk.

A heartfelt thank you to The Concierge Danny who deserves a special mention. He was a mind of information. We felt that he went above and beyond the call of duty helping us to book train tickets, giving advice on city tours as well as general information re places to visit and recommending restaurants in the locality. All done with a warm friendly smile. 
Would definitely recommend the hotel.",Honestly I can’t think of a single thing 😁,"

", 9.0 ,The room was a good size. Very clean and very comfortable. Wasn’t sure if coffee was free in room so didn’t use just in case we got charged. So bought coffee downstairs in cafe which was very good. Also it was very handy to leave our suitcases there all day as we had a very late flight,The technology wasn’t very clear on using the remote so couldn’t find out the information we needed. We were not happy about all the taxes we were charged (meal tax???) we only had a couple of drinks at the bar but we were charged a meal tax. Didn’t happen in a previous hotel so why here?  Also including the service charge in the bill too is not right.,"

", 9.0 ,"The property was nice and clean throughout and the staff was very inviting and helpful. Breakfast was delicious. The fitness center is great, all new equipment. The self serve beer in the lobby is genius. Also, my daughter needed a lint roller during our stay as she’d forgotten hers at home and on a whim I asked the front desk if they happened to have one and what do you know one of the employees had a personal one that they let us borrow! That was extremely helpful and made my daughters day. One of the best hotel experiences I’ve ever had.","While the valet parking crew was awesome, it was clear that they were stretched thin at times. They always made an effort to pull our vehicle around very quickly and as long as we called down to them ahead of time (10-15 minutes) our vehicle was ready by the time we made it down. But, when a flood of check in’s and folks stepping out for the evening collided on Friday around 5:30pm it proved to be a challenge for them. Wait times to pull your vehicle around skyrocketed. I still tipped them because they were so apologetic and made an effort to move as fast as they could given the circumstances. Maybe management could communicate with them better to let them know how many check in’s are still expected for any particular day so they can plan to have more ppl working on high check in days. Especially around sporting events or other local events. There was a Boston Bruins game going on that day which I think was the cause of the spike in check in’s.","

Loved that it was dog friendly, and very much enjoyed watching people walking their dogs in the park. Also enjoyed watching the wildlife in the park the two little bunnies and the really really dark colored squirrel.","The room was beautiful staff was great, was over charged for drinks. When we picked up the two drinks she told us they were $7 a piece my charge was for $30 and then $8 for the two Cokes so I think she charged us twice for the alcoholic drinks. I also probably would have been more satisfied had I been aware that a $250 room was going to tally up to 409 for one night. I did not find the bed comfortable however that could have just been a matter of personal preference I just found it a little hard. It really is a beautiful motel if I get to stay again I'd really love to check out the pool and I wish that the concierge at the front desk would have let me know that it was on the roof that's really cool I would have liked to have checked that out.","

The hotel staff were friendly and efficient. The amenities it offered (gym and pool) were good as well, and they were available under an extensive schedule. The hotel had a complementary breakfast.","The area around the hotel is not very walkable if you compare it to the rest of Boston. Although it is technically within the city, it can be a bit far from restaurants and points of interest (by walking). The nearest place of interest is Harpoon Brewery (6 minutes walk), but the main Seaport area (where the closest restaurants were) is within 15 minute walk.","

", 8.0 ,"This hotel is serviceable if you need to spend the night in Boston before flying out of Logan Airport the next day.  They have a free shuttle every 30 minutes to Logan beginning at 3 am.
The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly.  We left too early to comment on the breakfast.
There's a small pub if you want to have a glass of wine or beer before retiring for the night.  However the wine is a bit overpriced and they don't have too many options.  In a city with so many people of Irish ancestry they should have Guinness on tap.","There is not too much around the hotel in the way of restaurants.  I would have expected a little more activity including things like pharmacies, grocery stores, etc. but it seems more like a commercial/industrial area with some hotels mixed in occasionally.
So if you stay here plan on checking in and settling in for the night because there's not much around... at least from what I could see.
I stayed here previously and paid almost $40 less for the night.  I think what I paid for my stay this time was a little steep.  I will compare and contrast other places next time and see if there is better value.  I saw other hotels in the vicinity.","

", 9.0 ,The room was very spacious and very clean and beautiful.,"The restaurant was only doing take out style and we specifically had inquired about it since we knew after a long week of travel and  having to get up very early for the airport we wanted something to eat that was convenient and relaxing. Wish we would have known it was like that
 beforehand because we would have chosen to eat elsewhere before we got into the hotel. Nothing very easy to get to nearby.  It's also a very simple menu selection, not what I had in mind. It is an extremely busy hotel and we.had to wait quite a while to even order something and then hang around in the lobby and wait for it. I'm not sure if this is the way they always do it now or it was just the night we were there due to a staff shortage. There was a sign on the bar that notified us of this situation but it was too late at that point to make another decision because we didn't feel like going anywhere else and we had already returned our rental car. We didn't want to spend any more money on a cab or Uber at that point either. I was
 very happy to get some drinks from the bar after such an exhausting day.","

", 7.0 ,"Conveniently located relative to the airport for an overnight stay. Quick check in, and appreciated that the shuttle came to pick me up at 11:30pm to bring me to the hotel. Room was bigger than expected, clean and quiet. Shuttles depart to the airport every half hour in the morning. Free breakfast had good options and was a nice touch.","Because I arrived so late it felt like most of the staff had clocked off, so the service was not very attentive. The breakfast was good, but I wish it wasn’t all served on disposable cups and plates! It felt very wasteful to see so much rubbish collectively generated from the morning meal.","

C203 is where the bus picks you up from Boston airport - important to know!,"The guy on reception wasn't too welcoming. He didn't explain how to get to the room and was rude on the phone when we asked where to get the bus from the airport.
On getting to the room, there was an odd smell. We found a mouldy sandwich in a ziplock bag in the fridge. When we told reception, nothing was done about it. 
There is no sign at the airport so most of us getting on the bus weren't sure we were I'm the right place.","

", 7.0 ,"Very central, you can walk to most attractions. Rooms are clean, microwave and ice machine available on every floor. 
We bought the Boston Trolley hop on hop off tickets that turned out to be a waste of money because most attractions are so close to this hotel and so walkable. Metro stations are also very close.","Very bad value for money. Had to run the water for 5-10 minutes just to get it luke warm, there was no proper hot water, bad showering experience after spending all day outdoors in the cold. The windows don’t open to even the tiniest gap to get fresh air in so the room is always stuffy and doesn’t smell nice. The rooms are tiny and dated, the pictures are totally misleading. Our room option showed a large room with two double bed, spacious wardrobe and desk space. We couldn’t fit 2 winter jackets to the tiny thing that supposed to be the wardrobe because it was so small and half full with ironing board and whatever else. Also the only space to put our suitcases was front of this tiny cupboard so if we put something in we would have had to move our bags around every time to open the door. 
Our room description mentioned it will be only one bed but we expected it to be similar size on the pictures shown with usable wardrobe space and at least enough space to comfortably leave our bags and be able to walk around our bed but this wasn’t the case. We stayed here for 4 nights and paid nearly €30 extra a night for having a bigger room but it’s a pure rip off. They show you a large room and give you a tiny one. Other properties nearby have much better room options for less money. If we knew this we would have stayed elsewhere.","

Police response was fast w/7 officers. She has three very young children who were terrified by the threats coming from the drunk group. They ended up removing 4 (not sure why all of them were not removed??)
There's an entertainment theater next door that is very loud (music and people) from 10pm until around 2am. My family found it very difficult to get any sleep. We were separated in the by 5 floors (6th & 11th) and on different sides of hotel.
We had two TINY king rooms with uncomfortable beds. The rooms were so cramped, there was only 18"" between bed to wall and wall had large box that stuck out into the room by 8"" with  a TV inside. You had to angle your head away from the TV box was you walked by the bed.

", 4.0 ,The location was fantastic and was very easy to travel to/from. There was some valet staff outside the hotel which provided safety on a busy street.,"There were multiple aspects of my stay that were very unsatisfactory:
1. About 10 mins into my arrival I had called reception for two flute glasses. After waiting well over an hour I had to travel to the lobby wait in line at the front desk and ask again for these glasses. The receptionist led me to the bar and essentially walked away without saying anything.
2. The ice machine was broken on my floor.
3. There was no fridge in my room. I was not made away of this online and this was a very frustrating experience especially because there was no working ice on my floor. I would not have purchased a room without a fridge.
4. The towels were extremely rough and left this displeasing ""stickiness"" on my skin (they all felt like this).
5. The pillows were the most uncomfortable pillows I have ever slept on.
I rarely am interested in writing negative things about hotels, restaurants, etc, but I was very disappointed in so many things about my stay especially because the room was not cheap!","

The restaurant area has a nice open and friendly ambience, and food/snacks were good quality. 
Location was perfect for us, near Boston Common, and a subway stop that made getting to Fenway Park and Harvard easy. The freedom trail starts close by also so all the things we needed were within walking distance","Noise from neighbouring rooms and from street traffic (despite being on the 21st floor) was terrible. The hotel obviously know this is an issue as they provide ear plugs. There is music played (quite) loudly throughout the hotel (lobby, check-in, elevators, restrooms) so it’s hard to escape it when not in your room.

", 9.0 ,"First off I loved all the photo opportunities this hotel provides, it's an Instagram heaven for people. Me and my husband really loved the location, bars, restaurants, theatres, 2 different T stations within a short walking distance. I have a secret to tell you all, on the back of a coupon they give you at the front desk for free drinks/food at their bar, which was pretty cool, it says ""Limited Mini Fridge If Available"", your room does not come with a mini fridge FYI, so we called down to the front desk and they brought one to our room free of charge which obviously came in handy for the two days we stayed. I definitely recommend going to the rooftop to see the sunset, and or take a trip up there to see the city view at night, really comfortable with a couch, chairs, tables, you can bring your drinks up there and just hang out. I will say we didn't have an issue with hearing any of our neighbors next to us or above us which was nice. Thank god for the free sound machine in our room, lets just say it was very noisy and I needed it almost on full blast to sleep.","We did not like our view from our room, we were put on floor 13 and we booked the city view, we basically had the back or an ugly building to look at it, and got to people watch people living their lives in their apartments right across from us. It just wasn't high enough to have the view we were expecting to have, which I did ask for the highest room. I will also say the noise was so loud at times, and yes I understand were in a city and close to Chinatown, but I do not recommend staying on the 13th floor, try to go as high was as you can and maybe it will be quieter for you. All we heard was cars honking, sirens, the club right across the street blaring their music, cars revving their engines. I recommend that they look into playing some music on the roof level, to give it more of a fun vibe.","

The room was tiny and looked much bigger in the photos. Our door was ""automatic"" which took over a minute to close (you could not just shut it). One of the days the cleaning crew left supplies in our room. The room did not look cheap, but it felt very much like a Spirit flight, like a hotel room - the bare minimum.

", 8.0 ,"I really liked the whole setup and vibe. The gym was excellent, with top end cardio machines, and the ability to do a strong HIIT program with kettlebells, dumbbells, etc. I liked the way the $25 credits at the bar/restaurant worked, with the serve yourself/takeaway options being included. The few choices on menu to be served were great - bar was a great atmosphere with plenty of people either on computers or chatting or watching the large screen tv.  No issue if you were alone as lots of people were. I liked the setup in the room, with the addition of the white noise machine a good idea.  Location pretty good depending where you want to go in Boston - walkable to Little Italy and Fenuil Market and Boston Common (where the red and green line stations are).  I totally didnt mind the room setup (the table and chairs are hanging so you set up yourself) and didn't mind hanging my clothes on the pegs on the wall.  I loved it.","Having to go to the hall closet to get the additional toiletries was interesting, and the issue was the person checking me in did not tell me about it so you need to be proactive.  The reception also didnt tell me how the $25 vouchers worked so you need to figure that out (and might miss using them well depending on length of stay).  Reception also didnt talk about the business lounge, gym, etc without asking. Also, the shampoo in the room never worked and wasn't replaced when mentioned. Overall, these were minor.","

I do not like having to request housekeeping each day (especially for the price of the room) and would have preferred to have it automatically unless I requested not to have it. I also found it to be late in the day, around 4-5, which is the time when I want to rest after a day of sightseeing and before going out for the evening. The service itself was very good, I just would prefer it to be earlier and automatic.","

", 8.0 ,Overall the hotel was extremely convenient in relation to where I needed to be while staying in Boston. Everything I needed was within walking distance staff were very accommodating and giving me directions each day. Loved the Starbucks in the lobby and how amazing the staff were. The restaurants food was delicious and is it just a pop down to the lobby and pick it up.,I thought the shower could’ve been cleaned a little bit better And I did not appreciate that the railing was broken could’ve caused an accident had I actually needed it to get up. Also I was not impressed with the $10 a day charge for Wi-Fi after reading online at the hotel had free Wi-Fi. There are a couple hidden costs which you were unaware of until check-in that add up the initial cost if you stay. If you’re traveling on a budget it can be quite frustrating. But overall The friendliness of the staff made up for the minor inconveniences of the hidden costs. One staff member David Went above and beyond to accommodate and assist me he was brilliant.,"

Ended up in a room with a floor a/c unit with a hose running out.the window. Right next to the mold on the window sill. No breakfast was included. Old man Hilton would be proud. The company ripped me off just like he woulda liked. I will not be staying there again.","

Staff verbally committed more than a month prior but later disregarded and did not follow through at the time of our stay, resulting in a difficult and unenjoyable trip.

Bed was comfortable and room size was good- we got a king size room. 
Shower and toiletries amenities were adequate.
Love the free clam chowder token every night (or lunch if you want)- it was lovely and thick, came with a packet of dry biscuits to put into it and would fill me up for lunch very well.
Good security.
Restaurant had a good variety of meals and reasonable prices.","Why don't the big chain hotels supply free water to everyone like the smaller hotels do?? They had 2 bottles of water in the fridge but they were only free if you were a club member. 
And powder whitener for coffee/tea! Not even long life. Disappointing.
I know you can't predict, but I did ask on two different occasions whether it was necessary to book a taxi and was told ""no need, they're out the front"".

", 9.0 ,"The Hyatt Regency Boston is a large modern, full service North American business style hotel with all the usual amenities.  The hotel is located in Boston’s Theatre District which has all the coffee shops, restaurants, shopping, drug stores and other amenities you’re likely to need during your stay.  Many of the American Revolutionary historical sights are located within easy walking distance of the hotel.  The hotel is also just a couple of blocks away from the metro stations which gives you easy public transportation to other Boston area sights like Fenway Park, Museum of Fine Arts, Harvard University, etc.  
Overall we had a stay and would stay again. The front desk and staff were friendly, competent and courteous.  Check-in and check-out was painless and fast.  Our junior suite was clean with 2 flat-screen TV’s, good Wi-Fi and comfortable bed with nice bedding.  The room had a small fridge and coffee/tea maker but no microwave.","The main hotel lobby/front desk is actually located one level above the street entrance.  You have to take an elevator up one level to access the main lobby or the room elevators.  We found it inconvenient to have to wait for an elevator just to go up or down only one floor, especially when a lot of guests are coming or going.  If would have been nice if there was an adjacent set of stairs allowing us to just walk up or down one floor.","

", 9.0 ,"Arrived early to attend a matinee at Boston Opera House.  Was not sure if room would be ready or not.  Apparently a standard king was not available so I was “upsold” for $15 more to a king room on a higher floor, which was ready.  I would be surprised if hotel was 50% occupied the night before, so I suspect a standard king was actually available. However, I’m sure the Hyatt appreciated my extra $15. Regardless, my wife and I were happy to check in early.",Same as above.,"

Coffee machine in room and coffee was refilled every day, which was lovely. 
The location is excellent as well.","It's not really anything to complain about. But when you enter the building you are on street level. From there you take an elevator to the lobby.

", 9.0 ,"Really enjoyed my stay here. My room was clean and spacious, and having a kitchenette (and a portable induction cooktop borrowed from reception) was extremely useful. Staff at the hotel were all fantastic - very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was good - there were only a few vegan-friendly items, but it was nice to have these, and having free breakfast in an expensive city like Boston was very useful. Free coffee at reception 24/7 was a nice touch. The fitness area was spacious and well-equipped.","I found the rate quite expensive, but it was the weekend of the Boston Marathon, when prices are much higher everywhere in the city. I would recommend having a car if you're staying here, as the location is a little out of the way for most Boston sights and there's only one metro station 10-15 minutes away on foot. A few more vegan options at the breakfast would have been good.","

Very comfy king size bed in the room I choose, I appreciate the privacy blinds on the window, as well as the black out blinds on top! Bathroom was super clean with a very nice shower stall & adjustable shower head.  Full fridge, microwave, dishwasher, deep sink, garbage disposal, 4 trash cans throughout. Dishes & cookware. Plenty of storage for suitcases & clothing, even an iron & full ironing board. Huge rolling table to pull over to the sofa & eat your meals on! The most comfortable, & quiet, computer chair I've ever sat on! I also highly appreciated the Privacy Curtain between the couch area & the bed area. Staff was constantly available & very helpful!","The toaster in my room was very old school & very much a fire hazard, I told the front desk about this upon checking out of the hotel. The pillows were horrible!!!!! Oh my goodness, they need new pillows, firmer pillows that provide head & neck support. The pillows were waayy to soft & completely flat once you rest your head on them, I had neck pain & woke up with a slight headache the first 3 mornings. I did NOT sleep well for all 9 night because of the pillows. Also... the heater in the room was weird to adjust. There was only a 3 degree difference between freezing cold AC & very hot heat. Even at 76°, 77°,78° we got cold air instead of just warm air. Temp had to be 80° to 81° for heat, Ugh!!! It was frustrating at times. The sofa bed mattress was flat & uncomfortable & so was the rough thin ""blanket"" they provided for the sofa bed. Sitting on the sofa cushions was also unpleasant. The sofa fabric is rough & dry feeling against the skin, definitely not a soft comfy fabric at all! The kitchenette could use a flat top stove! The TV didn't show what you were watching on the channel. You'd have to go all the back to the guide, channel 1, just to see what's on & what you were watching,  annoying! The doors slam lock.... & I mean SLAM lock, you could hear other room doors nearby, all day & night, SLAMMING shut. That could be very annoying as well.","

", 7.0 ,"The location is obviously great, right in the middle of south bay mall. The hotel is nice. Breakfast was decent. There were eggs and oatmeal which is always better than just having cereal or a bagel. The staff was great, I just felt bad for them because they are clearly understaffed. This can't be good for morale or service in the long run I feel like if they continue understaffed quality will decrease. Prices are good too! Just wish there were more amenities like a fitness center, pool or something.",Understaffed. Wish the rooms were a tad bit bigger but I'm just being picky at a point.,"

", 9.0 ,"1) The location is absolutely FANTASTIC for 3 reasons: a) It is not too far from Downtown Boston and most other areas and attractions are very accessible in a short time; (b) It is located with excellent access to public transportation (the T and Bus services) and thereby making moving around to and from the hotel efficient, fast and low cost when one doesn't use Uber or Lyft; (c) It is located close to the South Bay Shopping strip offering excellent grocery and other shopping from the likes of Bed Bath and Beyond, Target, Nike, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Carters, etc. as well as a significant number of chain and other types of restaurants. All within 5 minutes walk. 
2) The structure is new and the rooms are well-appointed. Saw only the King Suites so cannot rate the double rooms. 
3) Rooms are well-equipped for long-stay with a microwave and fridge. This is excellent as there is no on-site restaurant and to eat in, one would have to order takeout. 
4) All-day dispensed coffee was a bonus.
5) I'm grateful to the staff member that made an immediate effort to ensure we got adjacent and connected rooms from our 3rd night ... I get the sense the other colleagues prior didn't make a good enough effort. I regret forgetting her name :-(.","1) The cleaning ... The staff need to make a better effort of communicating that rooms are cleaned only every 3rd day and then only with a booking on the 2nd night. At times, even when we booked, cleaning was not done. This resulted in our rooms being cleaned only 1.5 times in a 9-night stay! This is the reason for the low rating on ""Cleanliness"" above. Otherwise, the property is kept quite clean, as are the rooms when one checks in. The cleaning system needs to be more proactively managed by (a) Staff informing guests about the system and how it works at check-in (we were NOT informed); (b) the Hotel should more proactively check in with guests and *ASK* them on the 2nd night if they want to schedule cleaning. This is a reputational PLUS hygiene issue for the hotel and should be taken more seriously.
2) Breakfast: The breakfast is a bit of a dampner. It was very, very basic: all self-service and cold monotonous servings apart from the 2 waffle makers (also self-service). It is far from a full breakfast and the property is not equipped to deliver it. This isn't a complaint at all because the overall package gives value for money. I am only flagging this to give other guests a reality check!!
3) As there were 6 of us (2 adults, 4 kids ages 8-16) we needed to book 2 King suites and requested connecting or at worst adjacent rooms in advance: we got rooms on different *floors*! While we *DID* eventually get an adjoining/connecting room, it took several trips to the front desk; 2 different staff I met would say ""oh, we will put your request in the system"" and nothing changed. Fortunately one time I met with a very switched on and solicitous staff who took the time to immediately check their booking records and found that one of the rooms would have the adjacent one vacant and locked it in for us for the next day.
RECOMMENDATION: We noted that there were quite a number of large families or other groups.","

", 7.0 ,"The room was nice and overlooked the Charles river.  Half of the view was of an empty parking lot which was an eye sore, at night you couldn't tell though.
The free cookies up at the front desk were amazing and my kids loved them.
The Fusion restaurant had great food and was open late to accommodate our busy schedule.
The fitness room was very nice and had a lot of weights and machines to use.","The elevator in the parking garage was broken and no one notified us prior to us unloading our entire vehicle in our arms.
The coffee in the room was horrible and when I went down to the lobby to get some, they were charging $5 for Starbucks coffee from a machine. 
The whole reason I booked this hotel was because of the hot tub and pool. The hot tub was so unbearably hot that you couldn't stay in long at all. I asked multiple employees about turning the temperature down but no one could give me a straight answer short of ""turn the jets on"" (which btw does nothing for the water temp).
The shuttle service going downtown left the hotel late on our trip into town and then apparently arrived early at pick up which stranded us there until we had to pay for an Uber because we weren't willing to wait an additional two hours for the next pick up time.
The bed was so uncomfortable that every morning my husband and I woke up with a sore back, which never happens at home.
There is no lock or latch on the bedroom door to keep kids out.
There is no ventilation in the bathroom and the smoke alarm would go off if you showered with the door open. It's a little terrifying when you're butt naked thinking the fire crew is going to bust through the door.
In terms of location, I was hoping there were things around the hotel we could walk to but there really wasn't. It's in the middle of tons of lanes of traffic and nothing near it. You end up having to pay the $47 a day for the parking garage because there's no other place to park.
The only breakfast option at the hotel is a $30 breakfast buffet.  With a family of 5 staying for 3 nights that's a bit much.
Overall, I believe this hotel is more suited for the business/academic type with an expense account.  For a family I would recommend staying elsewhere.","

", 8.0 ,"I enjoyed how the hotel is displayed. It’s clean, looks and feels more than a 3 star hotel and the staff was friendly. The hotel comes with a hot tub, pool, bar/mini restaurant, a jazz room, and roof top restaurant.  It came with more activities than a regular 3 star hotel I’ve stayed at in the past.","I didn’t like how there was at times no hot water- the showers in the hotel room and the hot tub. 
I also didn’t like how the breakfast was overpriced. It was a regular breakfast any 3 star hotel offers, however this particular hotel charges for the regular breakfast. For 2 people, getting the breakfast buffet was about $60-$65. The breakfast wasn’t worth the money. 
I also didn’t like how people are charge for parking when the hotel parking is right there and if anything does happen to your car the hotel is not responsible, so why even pay? 
Also, in the email it says additional charges may apply but it could’ve been more specific and clear such as being charged $300 per day just in case for damages. However, if no damages are found, you’ll get your deposit money back. Still, I should’ve been more informed clearly and directly.","

Siocial distancing and Covid sfety measures were in place.entless,The lobby had a unusual strong flower like scent. Sort of like canles burning that was overwhelming. It was too strong. Actually it could be deemed borderline dangerous to someone with atstima or COPD which I have. So it was uncomfortable while in the lobby area. The smell was over barring. I suggest using a air purifier in that area that is scentless.,"

", 7.0 ,Location with river view is nice,"Web site specifically says in Covid notice section that pool and hot tub are open with some modifications in function due to Covid but the pool is not open at all. Also says breakfast is still available, only room service has been discontinued. It doesn’t say that the $23 breakfast is a microwave egg sandwich and a snack bar. Web site also lists overnight parking price at $45, but it is now $47. All relatively minor issues but together make enough that I would have gone elsewhere had I known.
**Update; received text from asst. mgr saying that if my stay wasn’t perfect they would “make it right”. After replying with my issues I received no reply for more than  a day, then received two identical texts within one minute asking how my stay IS going. Obviously a robo text, and not actually a manager checking on guests.","

", 5.0 ,Rooms are spacious and pretty clean. I go in and do my own cleaning before unpacking my things! Location is good for getting around Boston! I have stayed at this hotel about 5 times and after this time I’ve decided I won’t stay again or recommend even though I do like the rooms and location!,DESK staff is VERY UNFRIENDLY and overall RUDE!! On the other hand- restaurant staff was AMAZING and very attentive but I was charged $16 for 2 plain toasted bagels to go - that’s RIDICULOUS! Arrived on a Thursday - ice machine on my floor did not work so I had to attempt to search other floors for ice but it’s hard when can only access the floor you are staying on with your digital key! So I had to go stand in line at the front desk to ask where I could get ice only to get an eye roll and walked to the elevator so the girl could unlock another floor for me to get ice! I was still there for my 4th night on Sunday and the ice machine on my floor still did not work!! When I’m paying $450 a night for a hotel room I think I should at least be able to get ice easily! Shower handle was broken so water came out at a trickle from the shower head and flooded out at the faucet so that was also not great! Refrigerator was really nice but made a lot of noise but not as annoying loud as when the air conditioner turned on and off!! So didn’t get much sleep!!,"

They didn’t do a good job of explaining what was expected of you to start your meal. After that, the waitress was super nice. They didn’t clean the room every day which isn’t always necessary; but told us that if we wanted room service to come they would charge us for it. That extra charge discouraged us to use the house keeping. Parking was $58 a day and we never used the valet after checking in except to check out.

Also would have given a higher score for comfort, but one bed sagged (because, it turned out, the base was broken).
The ice machine on our floor was broken, and so had to go to another floor for ice. There was no indication of when it might be fixed.
Traffic noise was a bit of an issue - one morning there was a noisy truck at about 3 or 4 am","

Swimming pool is also nice.","Bathroom needed refurbishment, tiles broken, problem with water tap, but the hotel took into account our feedback and with commercial gesture we appreciated that.
Hotels in US tends not to provide room cleaning service anymore (except upon request) and I find that a bit strange but it's not the only one.","

It is a good place to stay ; what would really be nice is if the facility had onsite a small area to purchase food and other convenience items for the room, but you have to venture offsite behind the hotel to do this to a CVS and a Whole Foods Market behind the hotel which stay open relatively late.","

They sent a maintenance person to our room as the television was not getting all of the channels.  We were told there was a wiring problem in the wall so it could not be fixed.   Secondly, I requested a wake-up call to be sure we did not oversleep.  We were in the room for over an hour after the time requested and we received no call.  The desk told us there was no answer, but I am assuming they called the wrong room.  I think there might have been a good will effort made to comp us for something on our bill, such as part of the valet parking fee or a small reduction.","

Close to Whole Foods which made it convenient.,"Out of date carpet - looked old, dirty, and worn.  Bathroom was old and worn and drain was clogged in bathtub.  View was not good.  Couldn't close the curtains to darken the room.  Location was good but not fantastic and it was very expensive for the quality of the room that you get.  Breakfast not included and seemed expensive to eat there for dinner.  TV reception was poor.  Most channels were super grainy and hard to see the images on TV.  Not many good channels to choose from.  No streaming services.  Overall, old, run-down, and needed a lot of updates to the entire room in every way.   Would have not felt so bad staying there if it wasn't so expensive for what you get.","

We even walked to the Boston Harbor Walk (it was warm this weekend) may have Ubered if the temperature was freezing. Sam Addams brewery is right here. Tons of restaurants in the North End. A bunch of little bars. A liquor store right on the same street. An on-site bar and restaurant that is delicious with wonderful staff. The concierge are so friendly, noticed us coming in late at night with boxes of pastries and offered to send a refrigerator up to our room. It was up within ten minutes. The valet parking is easy and convenient, don’t complain about the $57 charge for valet daily. It’s cheap! You pull up and your car is taken, no headache of finding parking. I know places around Boston with $40 parking for two hours. The valet service is a MUST! Leave your car the whole stay and walk or Uber the city.","I honestly have no complaints. The room is on the smaller side but when we’re in Boston the room is where we sleep, we’re out the rest of the day. If you’re bigger, the shower might be a little tight for you in the standard king room.","

", 10 ,"The hotel is in a very central location with many, many restaurants, bars and shops within a short walk and most of the city centre sites easily walkable in 15 to 20 minutes. The staff went above and beyond to help us during our stay, the hotel was spotlessly clean and we had room service on every day we requested it. Yes, some of the rooms are small but it tells you the size of the room on booking.com and you can always chose to pay a little more for a larger room as we did. Yes, its expensive, but its a good quality centrally located hotel in one of the worlds greatest cities. What do you expect? Yes,, there was construction work in the locality, but its a vibrant booming city making it well worth a visit so of course there is development work going on. If no one was building, it would suggest its not popular so again what do you expect?",I agree with other reviews on the provision of a cool drawer rather than a fridge and the shortage of cloth hangers which seems a bit miserly when considering the cost of the rooms but these are really minor points in what is a superbly located well run hotel.,"

Very easy to walk to many sights and you are right next to the metro.,The room was very small and had a support beam in the middle of the very small sitting area. Not a lot of room for placing your suitcase. It was just my husband and I with 2 carry on cases and 2 backpacks. There was only 1 foot of walkway  on the left side of the bed. The shower leaked onto the floor so the bath mat would get soaked. I would hang it up but it would not drive.,"

Close to many historical sites.  The view from our room was mostly buildings, but we weren’t in room a lot anyway so it didn’t bother us .  Our stay was awesome !!  Excellent staff !! Front desk help welcomes you with a smile and a good attitude.  They are quick to answer any questions and acknowledge you daily. Check in and out was quick and easy.  Our room was clean and hospitality was good.  Our room ( King bed) was big enough for me and my spouse. Shower is small, but we didn’t have an issue with that. Room also had a cooler drawer which is for beverages or small to go box.  It’s not a refrigerator but it kept our items cool.  It doesn’t have a microwave.  The restaurant has excellent food and service.  Valet personnel Alberto went above and beyond with a smile. When he saw you coming toward the entrance, the door was open with a smile and great attitude !!  Dexter was good too !!   We highly recommend this hotel.  Next time we are in Boston, we will stay here again.",Wish it had a microwave .,"

He said to just call him if I need to change it.  I actually considered it at 2AM but thought it would be a waste of time.
Also, there is some kind of air circulation or fan in the bathroom that you cannot turn off.  The engineer told me to just close the door.  It helped but didn't make it quiet.","

", 7.0 ,"It was quiet. bed was comfortable. Nice size shower area, (we prefer a hand shower though as opposed to a big head). Lovely coffee bar. It would have been nice to have had even a light complimentary continental breakfast offered there and some fruit options available. Coffees were very good, but on the pricey side.  Large TV, thought we didn't use it very much. Room and premises were very clean, nice linens. Housekeeping staff were friendly and do a great job. They should be commended.  Desk staff were very friendly and very accommodating. Anything we asked for was brought immediately, (extra linens, luggage rack). Nice little entryway to room for privacy.  Central location not far from the greenway, harbor etc.. and very close access to the subway lines.","As forewarned the rooms are very tight for space, especially with the addition of a column in the corner. There really wasn't any where to put our luggage. We were always hitting the bottom corners of the bed with our shins. The management should consider soft-sided box springs, (more traditional bed frames), then this wouldn't be a problem. Watered puddled outside the shower every time. Need towel bars, no place to hang towels to dry, but we also don't like to ask for more towels everyday (increases laundry and wasteful). Some complimentary coffee, tea, lemon water, cookies in the lobby would be a nice addition.  The stay was a little on the pricey side for the size of the room.","

I understand the space is small, and you need to have a small shower, but I feel like there is easy leakage coming out of the shower onto the floor through the doors, like it didn’t seal great. I also think that having a fan/dehumidifier to whisk out the humidity from a shower would be beneficial, I feel like down the line since there is no way for the moisture to be removed, there may be soMe moisture issues in the room in the future. Unless there is a system I cannot see since it is hidden well.","

", 7.0 ,"Location was convenient with 7/11 just across the road, and walkable distance to back bay areas etc. Limited street parking lots and street was always under construction when we stayed (mid-August). Nice communal areas which were kept clean.
I liked that the shared bathroom had sufficient cubicles and we never had to wait for our turn. The cubicles were always clean and there were always fresh towels available for grabs on the racks, great effort from the cleaning ladies. Would have been better if there were racks under the mirrors to place toiletries on.","Lifts were old and slow, and we witnessed it going out of order one day and a team of maintenance guys/firefighters(?) were called on to help. Not sure how long it took to recover or if anyone was trapped within, but wouldn't want to be caught in that situation. 
Triple room was tiny, barely enough space to fit and open suitcases if there were 3 travellers. Platform bed design was also impractical because of the sharp protruding edges that eat into the barely available floorspace. Coupled with the odd placement of a protruding wooden TV frame, the layout rendered the inner side of the double bed (which was against the inner wall towards window) almost inaccessible - either you roll in on the bed, or angle your body to narrowly scrape between platform bedframe and TV frame. Watch out though - both frames come with sharp edges that are waiting to catch your unwary pinkie toes. We were 3 average sized Asian females with one suitcase each, only one of us could open the suitcase each time given how tiny the room was. Wouldn't recommend this option for anyone with bulkier belongings or bigger bones. 
Concierge staff were doing their job fine but didn't come across as personable or warm, which doesn't fit the youthful jovial hostel vibe given off by the hotel decor and facilities. 
Overall, bad value for money given the amenities, room sizes and depth of service.","

There were essentials such as dish soap and kitchen towels left. Air conditioning was a saviour with the hot weather while we were there. The TV had a good selection of channels. Bed was large and comfortable. Pillows were good quality. Nice view of the back of Berkeley street and nearby skyscrapers from our room. Great location, if you like walking you can easily walk to/from Fenway and into the city. We walked everywhere! Handy spot for getting Ubers too. Staff were very friendly and helpful, we had to check in extra late because of our plane making an emergency landing in another state and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or understanding.",Some surfaces were dusty. I dropped something behind the bedside locker and the amount of dust was off putting. The bedding consisted of a comforter/duvet topped by a sheet on either side - probably a cultural thing but I found this to be awkward at times - a duvet cover would have been much more comfortable.,"

On the plus side - the lady who was on the desk in the evening went to try to get me a coffee last night which I very much appreciated!","1. No coffee making facilities in the room or free 'to go' coffee available in the lobby - MINIMUM one should be available. 
2. Don't like the wet room bathroom - toilet gets covered in water and you end up stepping in water - this is a SAFETY HAZARD - as I stepped out onto the smooth concrete floor, slipped and now have severely painful back 
3. Breakfast - nothing offered and coffee bar is v limited - when you have that big attached restaurant space, (Mexican) you could offer a simple buffet breakfast
4. The Coffee bar had run out of yogurt so I had ½ a cup of granola for brekkie (it was also chocolate granola which kind of defeats the point of trying to eat healthily). 
5. There was an annoying buzzing in the room - like someone ringing to doorbell that a) disturbed me last evening and b) woke me at 4.30 am and went off every 10 mins for approx  2 hours. Reported to reception this morning.,","

", 8.0 ,"I liked the size of the room. It was well appointed and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and had the necessary amenities and I loved the hand held shower head. The dinner option at the restaurant was exquisite. Lobster with sides. The reading area was really nice and the staff at the front desk was helpful. I also suffer light sensitivity, so I am grateful that the lighting is not like most places blazing all the time. The soft yellow lights did the trick to illuminate what I needed to see in the hallways and the in the room. You can look out the window onto Fanuiel Hall and walk to the Harbor markets. It was the perfect location for my husband who was making his first trip to the city.","I hate carpet as a rule. Hotels have too much traffic to keep them nice on bare feet. Crunchy carpeting creates too many questions. The bed sheet was not contour to the bed and thus allowed the sheet to slip while resting. I know the number of people who had to have been in that bed and it creeps me out to not have a top sheet on that mattress, secured properly. I did not like that the refrigerator had the pay sensor soda situation. It almost cost me since I was unaware that it was not a typical frig and I could just move things around to fit my fruit and water and whatnot. The note that was passed to me with my keys was not enough, I should have been informed verbally that the refrigerator was cash operated and would cost an arm and a leg. No thank you.","

", 7.0 ,"The location of course…being right at the Faneuil Hall Market, near the waterfront & downtown is perfect.","Having grown up in Boston, always wanted to stay at the Bostonian which was considered THE place in the 80’s, but thought it overpriced. We needed a place for a night between the PTown ferry & Arlington. Decided to splurge, since it was only a night & the deals were good. 
I must say, after decades of anticipation, I was slightly disappointed. Staff - from door staff to front desk - were uniformly excellent. But our room (we booked a mini suite) - which we were told was an upgrade to a fireplace mini suite - was small & dark (facing the alley) & really nothing to write home about & felt in need of a makeover.  No “complaints” - but for less cost, I’d recently had a huge, bright, newly decorated harbor view room at the Seaport Hotel across from the Trade Center pier. The location is naturally figured into pricing - and you can’t beat the Bostonian’s location - but based solely on the room we stayed in, it’s time they looked into an upgrade.","

Door man was helpful. I liked the lobby although I didn't have time to relax there. Nice bookshelves with graphic black and white sofa.,"My bottom bed sheets were messy and never really stayed in place, was not tight enough, rather loosely fit. We opted not to have a maid come in since we were only staying for two nights. However a $25 service fee was charged regardless.  The breakfast waffle was terrible. Go with Golden Malted.com. Home fries potatoes not fresh.  We just came from the State Plaza Hotel in D.C breakfast there was the best.","

No warning that standard king rooms largely overlook a construction site and farmers market garbage collection area. But staff did the right thing by upgrading us to a superior room w city skyline view at no extra charge.  But it took some unpleasant complaining to get the right thing done. New room still had some rough edges that showed the hotel's age. Overall, having stayed at the Bostonian when it was among Boston's finest hotel, I'd say it's best days are behind it.","

Having the ability to grab water and the surprise of a free drink at the bar was awesome. The room was comfortable and the staff was amazing.,"The location of the folding table made it so that only one person could sit at it. The bed was too tall to be used as a comfortable seat. There was an ice bucket, but no indication of where to get ice and we were sorely missing a mini fridge.","

Having a bike available at the hotel was great, as I used it to get out to Cambridge and tour the Harvard campus with a beautiful ride along the way.","The resort fee is a bit confusing.  I noticed that many of the other hotels are using a similar system, and maybe this is just a non-taxable service...however, you do not have an option to refuse it for the amenities included, so it would be nice to just include it into the hotel fees.  Clearly, the cost of rooms in the center of the city are on the high end.  Costs aside, the hotel was great, and staff were very kind and helpful.","

It worth to go there at least to talk with him. btw, hotel provides 1 free drink in the bar for each guest.","1) Its is super overpriced for such hotel. Night costed around $260. maximum price for this hotel should not exceed $150 (incl. taxes). The hotel itself is old and rooms are really small. 
2) the receptionist David is very rude. we wanted to take bikes on the day of checkout for several hours. he said that for our safety and insurance he can not give them to use because we are moving out, which is not logical. I left there my credit card, my luggage was there. I would have returned there anyway. And the manner how he responded was rude. I would like to note that other 2 ladies wee very nice. 
3) I forgot book in the room when I was checking out in the morning. I returned back in the evening for my luggage, but they did not told me that I left it. I assume room was cleaned and someone would have found it. So they just decided to keep the book themselves. Not nice. 
4) On our first night, room had broken window. really weird. They changed the room, but it was surprising. does noone checks the room after the guests?","

In combination with the thick comforters, I had a sweltering night and had trouble falling asleep because it was so hot. The front desk recommended opening the windows, which helped but they were so dirty and grimy (obviously haven't been cleaned in ages) that my allergies definitely acted up. As other guests have mentioned, there's a $15 ""amenities"" fee they charge per night where you get a $10 credit for food/snacks in the fridge in the lobby. Honestly would've preferred to not have this fee and just buy bottled water/snacks on my own! They advertise that you can use bikes/wifi as well for the fee, but most hotels just consider those complimentary perks.","

They do send lengthy pre-check in messages, I'm surprised it isn't mentioned. They give the money back a few days after check-out, it's not a huge problem, just worth mentioning.

Management claimed this was due to short staffing caused by Covid, which is obviously fine, but wouldve preferred this be communicated clearer or attempts made to accommodate specific requests for sheets to be changed when asked, or for beds to be made daily regardless. Room was charged $50 deposit per day, capped at $200 for the stay (which again we were not told about). $15 per day amenity fee included in price as ""resort fee"" but room is given $10 back in credit for the bodega/fridge per day, which had a great range of snacks and was very generous, if poorly explained in pre-arrival. Also included unlimited bottled water (though cold tap water was safe and drinkable and chilled water available in reception) and unlimited tea and coffee capsules. Room had no wardrobe space to unpack clothes in to, no bathtub, bed only had 2 single duvets (apparently there were no duvets above single in any room).","

", 9.0 ,"I was so impressed with this hotel. At such a great price point, I was worried that it would be at the level of other hotels at similar rates. Absolutely not! the location was fantastic and we were able to access everywhere in the city by foot with ease from here. The rooms have everything you need, and the little Pineapple accents are adorable! The lobby contains touches like complimentary drinks and nibbles (I had three packets of the cookies - delicious) and we were gifted $10 credit to spend on snacks or drinks available in the lobby. The bar attached to the hotel had a great atmosphere and the cocktails were just what was needed. Finally, the real star of the show were the staff. Probably the friendliest, warmest and most attentive reception team I’ve encountered, they were seriously impressive. Just a fantastic stay all round!","A fire alarm did wake us briefly in the morning, but someone setting that off couldn’t be helped and we were back to sleep in no time.","

The theme and decor of the room itself is great, as it manages to make something as simple as a pineapple feel classy.",The size of the room was the only drawback in my opinion. It felt a little smaller than I expected and got a little chilly at night. We visited in December and if you stood near the windows at all it was noticeably cold.,"

The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean.  No stains on the carpet.  I can't say enough good things about our week long stay.,"Our bathroom could have been larger.  There wasn't much counter space in the bathroom and I feel like a shelf installed along the mirrored wall, above the toilet, could have been very useful.","

", 10 ,"My partner and I do quite a few hotel breaks a year, and we like to pick somewhere nice to truly feel we are away from all the stresses and rigmarole of everyday life. I can honestly say, however, in all my years of travel, I have never stayed somewhere as exceptional as the Langham, Boston. I am only just back in Ireland today after a 4 day stay and I am still raving about it to anyone who'll listen! So much so I am posting my first booking.com review! The experience we had at the Langham from start to finish was first class. After flying up from New York, we were pleasantly greeted on arrival and asked could concierge and team help us with anything from bags to a bite to eat or suggestions for evening sightseeing. We then checked into our executive club queen room. The room itself is spacious and the recent renovation shows. The decor is stylish, the high windows provide gorgeous light, and the furniture (most especially the bed!) is very comfy. It felt like the Langham had really captured the maritime tradition of the city in its fittings and colour choices. The whole room is spotlessly clean and maintained as such throughout the stay (which, although expected, is a big plus considering some mixed experiences I've had at luxury hotels down the years). The bathroom, complete with overhead shower, is likewise beautiful. The hotel itself also boasts a stunning decor. Building on its history as a federal reserve bank, the Langham has outfitted the space in a way that nods to its traditional roots while still incorporating all the comforts required for 21st century travel. The Grana Restaurant and the Fed Bar in particular have been spared no expense. While budgeting is always a key concern for those on the go, upgrading to the Executive Club in this hotel is definitely worth the money. The club, located on the 8th floor, provides a gorgeous view of Boston's financial heart.",N/A,"

Why is this standard? I am a healthcare professional who personally had to deal with dead bodies during the pandemic and Fox ""News"" called it a hoax? Why do I have to be submitted to this during my vacation? This should not be your standard TV station. Why do you need anything on the TV at all? Or just put on weather. That's what people want to see. I really free I deserve a partial refund. I will not stay at your hotel and will inform my ""woke"" friends. That term alone is so offensive and yet that was what I had to walk in to see when I ordered coffee first thing in the bistro.

It was a 90° day in the city and the window did not open wide enough to stay in the room especially for the price we were paying. The front desk staff never apologized and make us feel like an inconvenience. The front desk lady told us the hotel was fully booked and that there was no option but after pushing back she “magically” seemed to find a room for us, 3 hours after the whole issue started. Great facility but front desk staff did not seem to care to help at all and was truly disappointing for the Marriott standard.","

Seems where every other business made exceptions due to the continuing INTERNATIONAL CRISIS that some accommodation could have been made, i.e.: partial refund, etc. 
What I thought was a great deal with Booking.com turned out not to be such a great deal. Guess I’ll have to look around well with other services before considering Booking.com or this Boston hotel location again.

", 8.0 ,Loved the hotel,"Was a little disappointed that I've had my reservation for quite a while and thought I was getting a view of the water 
Apparently I was getting a view of the industrial area behind the hotel because I was charged $52 PER NIGHT EXTRA for a view of the water.  Did not appreciate that at all. 
Should've have had that view for the original reservation view. I would appreciate a partial refund for at least half that extra charge. I don't want to have to write that in my review.","

", 10 ,"The Encore is near perfect, many places to eat, things to do.","On our first night we were having drinks in one of the rooms when we were given a “final warning” by management for having too many people in the room and the music being loud. We never had gotten a first warning and had blocked out 4 rooms so we didn’t realize there was an issue gathering in one room for drinks before Memoire. The speaker is in the room provided by the hotel, it usually has a volume control past a certain time however this feature didn’t seem to be working or they had altered the time. Regardless this was a hotel provided feature that we were harassed by the staff about. I found it disappointing that management didn’t handle this situation better, it was a birthday weekend we had booked out 4 rooms including a  suite, spent 4k at Rare Steak house and booked a table back to back at Memoire for both nights. Total of nearly 20k spent before gambling in 48 hours, this is not how you treat clients of any standing especially ones that have pulled out all the stops for a great time for them and their friends.","

The staff are also very nice to let us have early check in without an extra fee because our flight arrived at 10 AM.,"- I do wish that the water taxi did run on the weekdays and it started earlier than 1:30 PM on the weekends.
- We had paid for a late check out for 1 PM But 10 AM we had banging on your door from housekeeping to check if we were leaving today. After answering that call I put the privacy sign on so I could sleep in but at 12:30 we had more banging on her door to ask if we’re leaving today and then at 12:55 we had more being at the door to see if we’re leaving today. So it was quite an inconvenient and frustrating because we had paid extra so we could have a relaxing morning before our flight but it was the exact opposite of that.","

As a coffee lover, I really appreciated the nespresso machine (one of the latest models) in the room and all the different capsules they provide.
we were here for a city trip to Boston, not for the casino, but we really didn’t mind the casino. it’s not in your way, if you want to join you can, but it doesn’t bother you in any possible way.
last but not least: the hotel is a bit out of the city (which comes with the perk that you’ll have a great night rest) and a uber or lyft will get you anywhere, and it’s not expensive.",not a single thing!,"

She was professional and personable and gave us an upgrade to a fantastic suite which had a dual aspect, was immaculately clean and afforded a kind of luxury we had never experienced before. The suite was HUGE! The beds were amazingly comfortable and the finishing touches was the use of Alexa and ipads for everything from television remote, ordering in room dining to closing the curtains and adjusting the room temperatures. 
The gardens were superb and tended to perfection, the restaurants within the hotel catered to all tastes and affortability.

Obviously the casino is there which we didn't use but that area was very busy. We ate in Red 8 twice and both times I was disappointed -food wasn't spicy enough and my tempura prawn dish had the batter on the outside of the prawns shell -and the service was slow too. I asked about the TEMPURA but was told in chinese temoura this is how it is done its the japanese way that I was expecting ! Very odd- a choking hazard with the way this dish was presented and the food in all the restaurants was extremely expensive -this dish was $36.99 but if you wanted steak your'e talking $ 60 upwards-no where near by to eat cheaper apart from Mc D !,"

It was like going to a High end hotel in Las Vegas without having to travel so far.,Thier was only complaint and it was a big one for me and my wife as we both had gastro bypass surgery a few years ago so we can't eat much. We went to one of the resteraunts in the Hotel. Now all these resteraunts are super expensive but we knew that going forward. The part that made us really upset is that we couldn't keep our leftovers cold unless we paid a ridiculous fee of 25.00 for a frig. This should be complementary as every hotel I ever stayed at had a frig to use for free. So we had to throw away our 30.00 a piece meals.,"

Room was extremely quiet, no noise heard from next door or even in the hallways.  Great comfortable bed for sleeping.","We arrived with another couple at 2:15 p.m. about an hour forty-five ahead of the scheduled check-in time.  Our traveling companions got a room right away.  We wanted one nearby but there wasn't one ready.  The  receptionist called housekeeping and asked them to prepare a room near our friends.  It took two hours of waiting, until 4:30, before we could get our room.  There was no place in the huge lobby to sit down so we just stood around after leaving our baggage in our fries' room.  Unacceptable.  
One other thing we found out is that there was no quiet bar anywhere in the huge complex that we could find to have a quiet drink and talk among friends.  One of our party uses a hearing aid and the incessant music played everyplace throughout the various bars and restaurants was not conducive to have a quiet discussion. over a nice cocktail.

", 8.0 ,It was fair.,I didn’t like the check in procedure. I made a booking through Booking.com from the UK. Got in and noticed that I had mistakenly done November rather than August. I got in touch with Booking.com who made an immediate modification and informed the Hilton yet I was disallowed from checking in and had to make alternative arrangements to sleep somewhere that night with all the travel stress. I came in the next day as was advised by a staff of the hotel who was not only hostile to me this time but also disallowed me from checking in. I had to make a new booking for the 5days I stayed in the hotel at a very exorbitant rate  not withstanding my status as a long standing Honors member. I have been asking for my refund for the initial approximately $500 I paid till  date and have been repeatedly tossed between Booking.com and Hilton without success.  This is an experience I will never wish anyone go through.,"

The restaurant was very nice..good menu and wine list.",The room I chose was much smaller than I thought it would be. I booked a superior king but the bed was definitely not a king size..closer to a queen and very uncomfortable..caused hip pain when sleeping on my side.  The AC didn't work very well..it was a very hot muggy day and tried turning it down to cool off after walking around all dat but it wouldnt go down past 71...not helpful.,"

The check-out clerk was rude and dismissive of our concern regarding a billing discrepancy (watch out for the destination charge, which was not part of our Booking booking - it was briefly mentioned at the time of check-in, a food credit was promised yet not applied, taxes were tacked on to it as well).  Upon talking to the manager and supervisor, the issue was resolved, which we appreciated, but one should not have to have such an unpleasant encounter at a hotel like this.  Also, note the overnight valet parking ($57) is good till 4pm the next day though we were told we should get the car out at the time of check-out (two valet clerks with different info).","

The shower was fantastic and had a great water flow.  The only downside was that there was no working vent in the bathroom so it was very hot and steamy in the bathroom after each person used it.  Would recommend some better ventilation in bathroom and the paint on the ceiling in the bathroom was starting to peel because of this very issue. Otherwise - really excellent room!,See above,"

", 9.0 ,"The room was borderline too small but extremely well laid out.  The bathroom, especially the shower was great!.  The room description didn't mention the refer which was an added bonus.  The large lounge area was great!  The hotel ran a shuttle for the Boston Marathon which was great but should have been mentioned, some of the desk staff didn't even know what the schedule was etc...but it was very important and much appreciated.  I would stay here again but the facility is a little too far away from many restaurant options.  That being said the attached restaurant was excellent.",N/A,"

", 7.0 ,The room was cool and definitely a hotel for a younger crowd.  The amenities were limited due to Covid so nothing wrong there.  I enjoyed the pool and the atmosphere! I also liked how touchless everything was!,"The walls were VERY thin for the price that was paid as well as the room size was a touch smaller than I thought although due to the size of the hotel, I am sure that is normal.  Because the walls were so thin, I got zero sleep both nights I was there and neither did my 8 year old daughter who was there for a dance convention.  It made for a slightly less than desirable visit.","

Because of this, we were not able to park in the parking lot even though we paid for it. We called the hotel staff concerning this, asking if there was somewhere else to park, and they told us to ""figure it out."" We weren't even reimbursed for the parking lot fee-- absolutely ridiculous, considering we didn't even get to use it overnight.

The bed was very comfy and the room was spotless.,"I didn’t like the fact that the rooms have the old TVs with cable instead of newer smart tvs. Another thing was the staff I had a problem with Laura I’m pretty sure was her name. So basically me and my fiancé where celebrating our birthday weekend Hers was Saturday mine was Sunday. I had gone to the lobby to ask for a lighter or some matches to light our BDay cake. There where two customers in front of me, there was a couple having issues checking in and the was another nice girl. Laura is the only receptionist in the lobby at this point. We where waiting for about 10 minutes when another receptionist shows up probably from break. Once I see she had taking care of her stuff I’m going up to her to ask her a quick question, when Laura goes over her and says to me with attitude umm excuse me sir she was in line first so we gotta take care of her. Again with attitude and with an extremely dirty look. To that I responded I just wanted to ask a simple question that’s all. The other girl asks me what’s your question I answer I just wanted to know if you guys have matches or sell lighters. Laura goes over the other girl and again with attitude says no we don’t have matches or lighters here. I leave the area very mad and frustrated at the encounter. The next day as I’m checking out I ask the guy at the front desk if they have matches he then pulls out a box full of matches. Very unprofessional of her and very poor customer service. I’ve been trying to reach the assistant general manager for the last couple of days with no luck. Great hotel awesome stay but 10/10 terrible customer service by some employees.","

", 5.0 ,"We were happy with the location. Valet was convenient and quick, even tho I felt it was a little expensive. Lots of choices in the re-fuel station which was convenient. Manny was very pleasant!","The bed only had a sheet and what seemed like a thicker sheet over it and the air was tough to get at a comfortable level. The air came from a main air system that was right in front of the bed and even when I turned it off, it kept blowing air. It was tough. A thicker blanket would have helped but there wasn’t one. For the price of the room I just expected so much more.  There was also no hotel pamphlet or info inside the room either which surprised me. I know everything is going digital but there wasn’t even a QR code or anything. Besides Manny, the staff just didn’t seem very friendly or eager to help(besides the valet, they were great.) The woman working the front desk in the morning just seemed cranky and condescending.","

", 10 ,"This is by far the best hotel I’ve stayed in. From the time we pulled up in our car to be escorted into the hotel by the gentleman outside with an infectious smile and welcoming friendliness only to be greeted by Francesca checking us in as if we were the priority guests of the day with friendliness and humor. Then the concierge Adam…WOW! He set us up with tickets to see the King Tut exhibit on short notice making sure we had enough time to enjoy it before having to be at our previously scheduled activity. He acknowledged us each and every time we exited and returned even if it was a wave if he was assisting another guest and always took an interest in our enjoyment of our time in Boston. We also utilized the spa to get the first massage my youngest daughter and I had ever gotten. They were accommodating to every concern and question we had and Peter was absolutely phenomenal; they even gave my oldest daughter a specialty gift since she was unable to get her massage due to early stage pregnancy. We ate several in room meals with the service and food outstanding every single time! The room was spacious, immaculate, and had a view that was gorgeous! The property is beautifully maintained; each time we walked into the hotel, both of my daughters would inhale and at the same time say how much they loved the smell.",Absolutely not one thing!,"

The sitout on the lobby level, overlooking the Boston Tea Party museum was very inviting with nice views & my room was nice & spacious.","I didnt like the bath tub, it was too deep and so difficult to get in and out & with no shower curtains the washroom got wet and messy. There was nothing asian in the in-room dining menu.","

First night there were guests in room next door or across form us talking so loud until 11:15 pm that we actually checked to see if they were sitting in the hallway (but no). Second morning a mother was talking to kid and we could hear her slab the child (including the crying of course).
Also too bad the minibar in the room was not available (again: bad for expensive hotel) and why no Keurig (coffee maker)hot chocolate cups for our child?
Showerdoor had a broken plastic strip (bad for expensive hotel) so every time we opened & closed the showerdoor you heard a loud Bang which was scary. Toiletbrush was missing (bad for an expensive hotel).

But the point of staying in a full service hotel is to get a full range of service - from housekeeping to an onsite bar or restaurant. To not get that amenity but pay as though you are, seems like a bit of a bait and switch. 18 months into a pandemic we should have it figured out how to offer a full range of services safely. Other Hotel Indigos in other parts of the country have open bars. Also not the hotel's fault but being next door to a new marijuana store is unfortunate.","

We only ate it  one day, then resorted to circle K.  First room very small and NOISY from the trains, highway, rooftop bar.  The wifi wouldn't work on my phone. We had to change rooms.

We did that however once we went downstairs to pick up the car we kept waiting at least another 15 minutes for our car. I understand that it was a weekend so it must have been busy but maybe next time front desk should tell us to call 30 minutes in advance. 
Additionally, the front desk man who worked there on Friday night was not the friendliest. I just asked him a simple question about the valet parking and he had a rude tone when responding back. 
Also I called the night before my stay because I wanted to see if our room would be available earlier just in case I arrived earlier. I'm not too sure who answered, but whoever picked up told me that I would need to call the day of around noon to make sure, which is fine. My next follow up question after that was asking if I can stay at the rooftop just in case I do arrive earlier and the room was not ready, and the man kept saying the same thing about having to call at noon, which is obviously not the answer to my question. So I kept trying to clarify my question and asked multiple times but he kept saying the same thing while giving me such a big attitude, which I did not appreciate at all. I just wanted to know if I can spend time at the rooftop just in case my room was not available. I used to work as a front desk person before too and I don't expect them to be super nice to me, but they should at least not be rude if I'm just asking simple questions.","

The second room they assigned me was on the 3rd floor and you could hear all the traffic and noise from outside. The walls were also thin enough that I could overhear the conversation in the room next door. Plus there were bags of garbage just casually left in the hallways. For the amount of money I spent you would think there would be proper maintenance or staff to upkeep the building.,"

The staff is friendly.,"The rooftop restaurant and bar is just okay. I would say overpriced and underwhelming food options. The hotel’s accounting system is antiquated and ridiculously not user friendly. The shame is that temporary holds of various amounts were charged against my credit card each night,$2500 worth and no one could explain why. The staff wasn’t knowledgeable about the hotel’s accounting system. It’s so noticeable because every staff member answered questions about our bill differently from previous staff member. Our bill confusion required a manager to pull up our charges on the hotel’s accounts audit to verify what we were actually charged. This was the Major major turn off.  I intend to reach out to corporate because I love the hotel brand and the Cambria concept.","

I asked two housekeepers that were cleaning the other rooms, they told me they had none.  I then went down to the front desk and ask the night girl that was on, she sent a guy up to my room with two hand towels.  Great!  Next we decided to check out the restaurant upstairs, to see if we might get a reservation.  We were met by two girls by the elevator and told we couldnt go in to check it out unless we had a reservation.

They also have solid smart TVs and strong wireless internet services for the rooms. Which I put to use working remotely from the room during the days. Also they are pet friendly. I had my cat with me who is receiving radiation treatments in the area.","Given the current COVID-19 situation and the hotel seemingly not that booked, I was surprised to be put into a room right next to other guests. Was wall-to-wall with a couple who were both coughing a fair bit. There were also guests somewhere close on the other side, could hear their door open and shut. During normal stays in Boston you expect to have neighbors, but was surprised for this stay to be in such close proximity. 
I'll be staying at the hotel again next week and I'm sure if I ask at the desk during check-in, they'll be willing to provide a room with more separation if possible. So not a big deal.","

Mind you I have a 2 year old who’s on a ventilator we decided to stay at that hotel because it was close to Boston Children’s Hospital. The next day I decided to let the manager know that the floor that we are staying on smells like marijuana she asked did I want to change my room but due to covid I honestly didn’t feel comfortable shifting from room to room, so she sent security upstairs with us to see which room the smell was coming from during the walk to my floor the security guard was explaining to my husband and I that a lot of young people come to the hotel and have parties and even prostitute. When that security guard said that I was so disappointed! Now the 2nd day of us being there someone above us was banging until 4am we could not sleep my husband had to go down and speak with security after he did that the banging and the loud noises stopped! Than we were charged for parking $25 a day and we had no parking! I will never ever again come to this hotel. I was very very disappointed.",N/A,"

Tv was a good size and had several subscriptions to chose from. And the Neighbour hood ( ink block) has some decent bars, convenience stores and eateries. The staff were nice enough. The property has a good lounge area & outdoor seats.","Rooms really lack wardrobe space,. We stayed for 4 nights and a half sized open wardrobe just didn’t cut it. The room was a mess with our luggage lying around. Coffee machine was terrible ( and so was the coffee). Leaked almost every time and the machine is very basic & not very intuitive! 
No room service in the hotel. Breakfast is expensive and quite limited. The location is not central but it’s relatively close ( walking of about 20-30 mins) to any of the sights - Boston commons, harbor, museums, etc","

It was Easter weekend, and the weekend before the Boston Marathon so room rates were high and opportunistic, which feels gross, but I guess it's the business.

Room wasn’t cleaned in spite of repeated assurances it would be. Hot water regulation in the shower malfunctioned constantly. Thermostat was mis-calibrated so the highest it would go was still frigid, but turning off the AC meant boiling in the summer heat.","

", 10 ,"Everything about the hotel was great. Location, staff, and atmosphere was excellent. Parking your car here is great too. You get your own spot so you can come and go as you please without the wait of valet getting your car. We were only supposed to stay two nights but decided to stay an extra night, and the hotel was very accommodating with this. Thank you!
 
The other thing that I liked was their response to the whole COVID situation. The hotel took every precaution to keep us safe and stop the spread. 
I would definitely recommend AC to anyone visiting Boston!","Not really the property, but they are doing construction next door, so if you have a room facing that way, which we did, you have those sounds to wake up to. Luckily it was only two of the four nights that it occurred.","

The person checking us in didn’t take the time to go over vital information for guests once she found out I booked there before. The hotel still has a hold on my money and has not released it after checking out. I never experienced having to wait for a hotel to release money that isn’t there’s. We won’t be booking here anymore.  I like to book with hotels that are professional no matter how many times you’ve booked with them and is prompt with releasing my money.

Every single staff member I encountered - from the doorman to the front desk to the cleaning personnel - proved incredibly friendly and service oriented, while seeming to take well deserved pride in their work.  I stayed 5 nights, so very much appreciated my top floor room with a very nice view of the river.  All other guests I witnessed during my stay appeared equally satisfied.
* Special orders  (flowers and online shopping) were waiting for me in my room upon arrival.  I hesitate to mention since I really, ideally should have coordinated my shopping ahead of time (and failed to do so).  Friend who ordered flowers reported ease in doing so.
** Hotel bicycle enabled a delightful excursion along the river.
*** Dinner at Peregrine restaurant - exquisite meal and service (as a single guest).  2x breakfast order also delicious.
Thank you Whitney team for doing what you do so well!",No negatives.  This hotel suited my needs perfectly.,"

The breakfast was fantastic - lots of food options and the lady looking after the breakfast was so friendly and helpful.,The location was a little odd but it was easy to walk to the train station to get a train (4 stops) into Boston or to get an Uber/Lyft. It was nice and close to the airport via Uber. The area around the train station is a bit dodgy but not too bad. The area directly around the hotel had good shops and some cafes and restaurants for dinner.  Paid a premium for accommodation as it was during Boston Marathon so value for money was average.,"

- staff/room service really helpful (requests via phone has been provided properly)
- public transportation nearby 
- a lot of shops right next door
- free Bath amenities","BREAKFAST: It’s a shame! you pay hundreds of bucks for the stay and for breakfast you literally get a bunch of trash. Everything is packed in plastic. it’s low-quality convenience food (e.g. disgusting omelette with a cheesish mess in it…).
To be fair: we have a hiring crisis in hospitality and it’s nothing special to use plastic/paper plates and plastic utensils but when you pay this much money it’s unacceptable. 
We really did not enjoy the breakfast and we were shocked about the circumstances. 
We would appreciate if the hotel management take into account our feedback and adjust the breakfast.","

", 10 ,"Staff was friendly and helpful. Public transportation ( Red Line) was about an 8-10 minute walk. Shopping center with Target, restaurants, etc was about 5 minutes walking. Have an airport shuttle that's $10/person and a quick trip to the airport. Hotel offers a ""buy it"" breakfast as well as a bar later in the day.","The free breakfast was a bit underwhelming. Cold cereal, packaged bagels and muffins, juice, coffee, apples and bananas, no egg option (even boiled) or toast. If you are offered that option, you might be better off getting the room a bit cheaper and buying breakfast in the Bistro, off the lobby. Really nice breakfast options.","

So as I was checking out/giving my keys back the gentleman at the front desk told me that he would refund the money for my room. I booked through booking.com so he told me I had to have them contact him and he would gladly authorize the refund. 
After many attempts at getting ahold of the front desk neither me nor Booking.com can reach anyone. 
On top of that, the $50 “security deposit” for being in a non smoking room that was to be returned upon checkout still has not been returned either","

", 3.0 ,That it was pet friendly,"A lot… unfortunately. We really wanted to love our stay but…
When we checked in the front doors were locked. There is no garbage can outside for pet waste. When I asked the front desk lady she said she would throw it away and put it in the garbage can behind her desk. I appreciate her not making me walk around with it or having to store it in my car. But still odd for the other days we were there a garbage can wasn’t placed outside.  And we had 2 rooms… both rooms (4 beds total) had stained sheets/bedding. Towels were also soiled and some of our plugs didn’t all work in the room. When we entered our room there was a dirty plastic knife in the middle of the floor. One of our beds didn’t have sheets and the mattress was stained. It was just a little disappointing because the pictures of the hotel are fun and trendy. If the rooms weren’t dirty I would have probably given it a 4.5. The no garbage can outside but dump the pet waste inside was just odd.","

I asked for a quiet room, but the room I was given was on the side of the building that faces the highway. The soundproofing was so bad that I could hear the cars and motorcycles all night.
The staff was ok, but the guy at the breakfast was pissed-off because I asked for a receipt ""nobody never asked for receipts""!

", 6.0 ,"For the price, compared to other Boston hotels I suppose I would say this is fair although I have stayed at similarly rated hotels with far better amenities. That being said, all the staff here were delightful  - the rating goes to the property alone. 
I was travelling for work and here for 5 days so I think I have a decent assessment:
- My room (203) was above some kind of main back door staff entrance - it slammed night and day and shook the walls
- It was also above some kind of inbound phone line that no one ever answered and which rang from 6 am onwards daily NON STOP. 
- housekeeping was between 8 am and noon ( i think?) - or 8 am and 3 pm - no one had a clear answer, however they would ""knock"" daily before 9 am quiet as church mice and if you happened to be awake and hear the whisper of a knock you might get your carpet floor SWEPT + new towels . thats it . Without a detailed hand written note to them I would never have had my bathroom cleaned, toilet paper + tissues replaced, or sheets changed despite a week long stay. 
Again - not at all a comment on the staff - the whole team was amazing - purely a comment on the calibre of the hotel- they SWEEP the carpets. Not a vacuum in sight. I found not one but TWO USED dental floss sticks - one behind the coffee machine and one under the bench -after the third day I finally picked the bench one up when I realized the property didn't believe in vacuums or deep cleaning . 
Also the wallpaper was peeling off in several places + floorboards looked like they had never been scrubbed. 
Add to that spending $30 USD everytime you need to leave the hotel bc you're in the actual boonies + I'm not really sure what you're getting","housekeeping - not the people, but the actual service. The team was lovely - the property standards were low.","

2. Staffs were RUDE and service was INSUFFICIENT. We stayed for five nights and didn’t get a complete room service for EVEN ONCE. (NO taking out trash, NO remaking the bed, NO water unless requested). 
On the second day, the cleaning staff kindly refused to come back later. On the third night, front desk staff told me that service need to be requested in advance (which I was never informed upon check-in). I requested and the next night, another front desk staff told me that no records of this request existed/have been put in. I got two bottles of water and towels from the front desk instead. I tried to put in a request again that night, and the next day I came back WITH ROOM UNCLEANED.
I talked to a third different front desk staff and this time they were being EXTRA rude about it. Not only did they say no record AGAIN, they also didn’t apologize or made an attempt to offer any towels or room amenities I am supposed to be GUARANTEED. I left the following day very disappointed.","

", 5.0 ,"Clean, safe, comfortable hotel with very good staff. Lots of food options within walking distance. It's easy to get to Downtown by walking to a bus stop. The neighborhood feels safe, even after dark. Good value for its price.","I made my reservation days in advance and the hotel confirmed it. The morning before my first night they call me to tell me that they have to cancel the last of my 4 nights reserved because the hotel was going to be closed. They told me that they were willing to cancel my reservation. I was unable to cancel the reservation because I was unable to find another hotel that I could afford in such a short notice, so I reserved that one night in another hotel. The morning after my last night I had to move to the other hotel and made me run late to the event I travelled for. I felt this was very disorganized and unprofessional. How can you cancel a night of a reservation after you confirmed it?","

", 6.0 ,5 minute drive to the orange line train station that took us right in to the city.,"There was not much to this hotel. No amenities. There was a spot for a breakfast, but it was never served, not even to go items. Our first room was horrible. Very small, not enough room for two people for four days. The wallpaper was stained and peeling in the bathroom, we found hair in the bed sheets, light bulbs were blown out and one lamp didn't even plug into the outlet. They did give us a new room, but that room still had a stain on the rug and stains on the wall paper in the bathroom. One roll of toilet paper, not many towels, no hair dryer, no safe. This is a bare bones hotel, if you are just passing through and need somewhere to crash this would be it. For us to stay for 4 days it was not a great choice.","

The desk staff was also great.","The only way to check in early was to upgrade our room. Seemed like a scam. Everyone was there early because the concert started at 4pm.
Also, upon checkout there is a big bowl filled with sanitizer that you put your used key in. Just gross looking -- actually felt unsanitary to see all the cards just floating in a giant bowl. Sanitize them in the backroom. Keep it professional up front.","

Loved the roof top terrace, and kid took advantage of the pool. Superb breakfast!","The construction that was going on right outside our window, practically. While this is not the hotels fault, maybe some kind of notice? The last day we were there they started at 6:30 am or earlier with the bulldozer! That was a bit of a disappointment.
Also, when the valet went to get our car, the battery was dead. Apparently somehow an interior light was on that no one seemed to notice. The employee was going to use another customer’s car, until my husband stepped in to say he was not comfortable with that. Supervisor said he would compensate us a one night’s cost, which was kind of him, but rather expected he should. Perhaps in training make sure parking valet’s check these things? Difficult time jumping the car as it sat for 5 days with the light on.","

There were extremely limited options and the toaster got jammed right as we got there.  We checked out shortly after breakfast and had to go find another breakfast option b/c my teen son found the breakfast so lacking and was still hungry.,"

If it weren't for COVID, we'd have been able to eat at the hotel but we bought food in the lobby and that was gross. The hotel should just open a little convenience store and have available what a 711 would have. They could charge more and people would still buy it. We would have. They just need better selection.

The front desk staff was passive-aggressive.  When you had questions, I got sighs or “that is not possible.  For example, the lights were not working, so I called and the front desk person sighed and said, don't you see the master switch?”  This switch was NOT in the bathroom where the switch was not working.  It was not obvious so the attitude about my problem was unprofessional and inappropriate. The parking scanner did not work most of the time
The housekeepers were aggressive about getting in the room.  Your website says, cleaning upon request.  I did not request a cleaning due to Covid, but they came in anyway.  Knocked several times in the morning.
I also had to request items more than once.  For example, I called for more towels, and an hour later I called back to ask where they were, and the front desk staff person argued that I did not answer the door.  After probing, she admitted that she told room service the wrong room number.","

", 6.0 ,"The staff were all terrific--front desk staff, management, and breakfast providers. They were friendly, courteous, welcoming, available and solved problems quickly. The cleaning staff were friendly, but some were much better than others in thoroughness. My room had a well-equipped kitchen, and a large work desk, which is why I chose this hotel. The gym is well equipped, and fairly well cleaned, but too warm. The salt pool is lovely, and the internal courtyard is also lovely (however, the grill was broken and remained so).","The lobby is unfortunate. It's a generic looking cafeteria style breakfast area. That is not a welcoming entrance.The view is the huge problem. 3 of 4 sides of the hotel face really ugly parking lots, a DHL facility with a huge parking lot and tractor trailers, and the side of the convention center where the loading docks are. The 4th side faces the hotel opposite the way, the ALoft. I highly recommend you request a room on that side of the building. Healthy breakfast options are pretty minimal. Sugary cereals, sugary oatmeals, sugary muffins, sugary fruit juice, hard boiled eggs, apples or oranges. On the weekend, they also offer scrambled eggs with some vegetable additions. The location is not ideal, but there is a great park across the street with live music and family friendly games (ping pong, huge swings, corn hole) on the weekends. There are few stores/restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk.","

I know it's covid times - but I was expecting a better breakfast and I had to wait for Sheets for pullout sofa.   I picked it for free parking and couldn't find the place that stated free parking - so it would have been $28 per day.   I could have gotten a better value elsewhere.,"

The gentleman at the breakfast bar was very friendly and patient with guests.,Our room wasn’t cleaned very well. The dishwasher was still running with dishes in it. The floors weren’t cleaned well. Not enough hand soap for the bathroom sink. Asked for a higher floor but were told none were available for early check in although our family members who arrived 10 minutes later were given very clean rooms on the fifth floor and we paid $25 more per night.,"
