", 10 ,"After a disastrous travel day, I was desperately searching for a hotel with an available room.  I found the Newbury through Booking.com (after midnight)...upon arrival the staff was incredibly kind, the hotel was beautiful, the room and the shower were so lovely and so very welcome at that point in the day.  The Nespresso machine in the room and the real china cup to drink coffee from were above and beyond and such a needed balance to the rest of the day.  The hotel is pricey - or perhaps just my late notice room was - but to me it was worth every penny.  I'd love to see it in daylight :-)",not a thing,"

", 9.0 ,"We stayed at the Newbury for 4 nights. The location is absolutely perfect! The building is charming and the build out of this historic property is beautifully done.  The staff were wonderful… pleasant, helpful and professional.  Macie (sp?)- the Concierge- was incredibly helpful with everything we needed.  We loved the Street Bar- excellent drinks and atmosphere. Valet team was fantastic- had my husbands car ready for him at the time he requested every morning and he raved about the complimentary coffee and pastry in the Library.  Brunch at Contessa on Sunday was delicious and gorgeous.  The rooms were nicely appointed and beautifully done…. so quiet and incredibly clean and maintained… however…see below","We had a park view room on the 6th Floor.  There was a constant smell of kitchen exhaust in the hallways walking to and from our room every day. if the smell of cooking meat is an issue for you- do not stay on a lower floor. The cooking smell was not present in the room, but we did have another smell issue in the bathroom- there was a mildew smell in the shower- presumably from the drain.  It was bearable, but noticeable. The phone and iPad were not operational- the phone needed to be re-programmed and we were told they were having issues with the iPads not working- they only show the time and hotel information.  Not a deal breaker, but would have been a nice perk.  The only other issue - a suggestion really- for those of us who like a dark room to sleep in, it would be great to have a strip of something across the top of the curtains (which are lovely btw!) to block out the morning sun.","

The card did not work to one of our two rooms, so they had to be programmed twice. It took an hour each time, which can make a difference to tired travelers, but once it was resolved, everything else was more than great. There isn't a pool, but we did not go to Boston to swim, so it's nothing we were concerned about.","

", 8.0 ,"We arrived and checked into the Boston Park Plaza before 11.30 on the 31st. Fortunately we were able to check in early and get our rooms straight away as we were heading out first thing to Salem for the Halloween Celebrations. Valet parking was also very smooth upon arrival. 
The Park Plaza is a massive 4* hotel with a deep and iconic history dating all the way back to 1927. Location wise the hotel is extremely close to Boston Common and Downtown Boston. The closest T station is Arlington if you’re planning to get around using it.
Check in and the few staff interactions we had during the stay were pleasant and professional. 
My dad and I shared a twin room and it was a decent size with a good view over the city. My sister was in one of the “Wicked Small” rooms. It was defiantly small but she enjoyed and it had all the amenities she needed. Particular highlights of the rooms were the really comfy beds and the nice deep bath which I availed of twice.
The hotels décor was very fancy and you could tell it was historic. The bar/lobby area looked fantastic and they even had a cute gift shop on the grounds as well as a Starbucks. Dad and I also enjoyed two after dinner nights in M.J. O’Connor’s, the hotels cosy Irish pub.
We’d all stay again in the Plaza the next time we’re in town.",NA,"

When sitting on the toilet, you’re practically in the shower, and when you’re in the shower, the curtain is definitely sticking to you. Also, there’s no room service, which is inconvenient, and the internet service was extremely weak. For the price, I expected much more.","

", 9.0 ,"The hotel is in a great location. Literally a minutes walk from the exit of Arlington subway stop. We asked to change our room as the initial one allocated to us  had a lot of traffic noise. The staff immediately arranged a room facing an internal courtyard and it was beautiful. Rooms are very well equipped and comfortable. Lovely and dark at night too thanks to the design of the blinds.  We slept like logs, apart from Saturday night when the fire alarm went off. (Thankfully it turned out to be a false alarm!). Very friendly staff throughout the hotel, especially the lovely lady who looked after us at breakfast.","The Gym was closed at 6pm on Saturday and some of the exercise bikes weren't working properly on the 2 occasions my husband went down to use the facility. We found the WiFi a bit  patchy, especially upstairs. Overall though we felt it was a very good choice of hotel.","

", 7.0 ,"I chose this hotel instead of the downtown location because of the lower price. The train station is a 5 min walk down the road, so it's convenient if you want to explore the city. The room suited our needs with some good amenities. The beds were very soft and comfortable.
The overall experience was not too bad.","The view is nothing to write home about. Industrial view of the Santander parking lot across the street.
This place could use some upkeep. The front doors are stiff and difficult to open unless you press the automatic door opener every time. Even the automatic door opener is a bit finicky.
Like other reviewers, I also had the experience of the tub draining very slowly. The water drained eventually, but it's not a pleasant experience to stand in dirty water when you're trying to shower.
We didn't bother to try the breakfast since it cost extra and the quality looked about the same as any continental breakfast.
I was excited to stay in a DoubleTree for the first time since I'd heard good things about the cookies. However, they were disappointing. They were warm, but dry. Also, I never knew they contained nuts. Seems unnecessary given the amount of people with nut allergies. Most people prefer a regular chocolate chip cookie, so adding nuts just seems like a waste.
For the price point, the standards should be higher. Next time, I'd choose a different hotel over DoubleTree..","

The staff was so nice and very accommodating.","Parking our car for $70 a night was very steep, so a break on that for guests would be cool.  I would suggest having a better bar on the property to match the cool vibe of the hotel.  The bar that is there now didn't make great drinks and not a place we wanted to hang out very long.","

Although we recognize this is the""Standard American Diet"" (and the most cost effective for the hotel), for a $700/night stay it would have been nice to have more options for those of us who are keto/paleo, especially for health reasons.  Also, the shower stall in the room was very modern and unique,but the tile on the floor of the shower was pretty slippery, which could be a little risky.","

Location is an easy, fast Uber drive to most locations in Boston / Cambridge but you can't really walk to a lot of places.

Also the location is 4 start worthy if you plan to get a Charlie card and take the public transit system.  If you rented a vehicle the free parking is also somewhat of a rare find.","Sadly the restaurant shut down during the pandemic so room service and staying in is not an option. 
While I did enjoy the modern art and all night coffee bar the rooms are small and the view, not spectacular. The carpet was lifting up on areas, bathrooms needed to be recaulked and the elevators were painfully slow.  There is no pool and outside of your room precious little space to relax if it’s been raining.","

", 9.0 ,Breakfast was good. I appreciate the staff bringing me the microwave when I asked.,"There was no bar soap. The staff explained that the supplier failed to supply for a few weeks.  I don’t really care. I was expecting to wash hands with soap, not shower gel. If I were the manager, I would buy bars soap in a supermarket and give it at least to customers who explicitly expressed that they would prefer bar soap. A $3 piece of soap now costs you a decrease in my rating,  which would otherwise be excellent.","

", 8.0 ,"the hotel accommodated my wish for a good view of the harbor. The facilities were very neat and clean and the bathroom had HP adapted facilities, some of the best I have seen. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating.","as a person with a disability I use a power wheelchair and Hoyer lift to access the bed. It would be great if there were standard heights for a bed so that Hoyer lift can fit under it. Like  8 inches of clearance. As it was, this hotel like many hotels had a box type set up under the mattress. Other places I have been to remove the box portion and put the leg rests of the bed up on wooden supports to raise the height of the bed. At this hotel, they very quickly and courteously had 2 or 3 hotel staff come to the room and lift the end of the box bring up so we could fit the lift under the bed. Kinda bad for them and a little annoying for us, though they were very nice, I wish it were not such an issue every time I go someplace.","

", 10 ,"The rooms were lovely, very clean and spacious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The general area did have some things to do and see but it was a 30 mins walk to downtown.",The breakfast area doors were usually closed by 9:15am even though we were told breakfast went until 9:30. It would be nice to have accessibility to breakfast until 9:30 and then you can take you time to eat outside the breakfast area. We learned to come down early after our first day but saw several people get turned away.,"
